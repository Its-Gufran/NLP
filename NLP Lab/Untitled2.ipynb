also known as football field football ground soccer field soccer pitch or pitch Glossary Glossary of association football Presence Country or region Worldwide Olympic Mens since the Olympics and womens since the Olympics Paralympic aside since and aside from to Association football more commonly known as football or soccer a is a team sport played between two teams of players each who primarily use their feet to propel a ball around a rectangular field called a pitch The objective of the game is to score more goals than the opposing team by moving the ball beyond the goal line into a rectangularframed goal defended by the opposing team Traditionally the game has been played over two minute halves for a total match time of minutes With an estimated million players active in over countries and territories it is the worlds most popular sport The game of association football is played in accordance with the Laws of the Game a set of rules that has been in effect since and maintained by the IFAB since The game is played with a football that is cm in in circumference The two teams compete to get the ball into the other teams goal between the posts under the bar and across the goal line thereby scoring a goal When the ball is in play the players mainly use their feet but may use any other part of their body except for their hands or arms to control strike or pass the ball Only the goalkeepers may use their hands and arms and only then within the penalty area The team that has scored more goals at the end of the game is the winner There are situations where a goal can be disallowed such as an offside call or a foul in the buildup to the goal Depending on the format of the competition an equal number of goals scored may result in a draw being declared or the game goes into extra time or a penalty shootout Internationally association football is governed by FIFA Under FIFA there are six continental confederations AFC CAF CONCACAF CONMEBOL OFC and UEFA Of these confederations CONMEBOL is the oldest one being founded in National associations eg The FA or JFA are responsible for managing the game in their own countries both professionally and at an amateur level and coordinating competitions in accordance with the Laws of the Game The most senior and prestigious international competitions are the FIFA World Cup and the FIFA Womens World Cup The mens World Cup is the mostviewed sporting event in the world surpassing the Olympic Games The two most prestigious competitions in European club football are the UEFA Champions League and the UEFA Womens Champions League which attract an extensive television audience throughout the world Since the final of the mens tournament has been the mostwatched annual sporting event in the world Name Main article Names for association football Association football is one of a family of football codes that emerged from various ball games played worldwide since antiquity Within the Englishspeaking world the sport is now usually called football in Great Britain and most of Ulster in the north of Ireland whereas people usually call it soccer in regions and countries where other codes of football are prevalent such as Australia Canada South Africa most of Ireland excluding Ulster and the United States A notable exception is New Zealand where in the first two decades of the st century under the influence of international television football has been gaining prevalence despite the dominance of other codes of football namely rugby union and rugby league The term soccer comes from Oxford er slang which was prevalent at the University of Oxford in England from about and is thought to have been borrowed from the slang of Rugby School Initially spelt assoccer a shortening of association it was later reduced to the modern spelling This form of slang also gave rise to rugger for rugby football fiver and tenner for five pound and ten pound notes and the nowarchaic footer that was also a name for association football The word soccer arrived at its current form in and was first recorded in in the earlier form of socca History Main article History of association football For a chronological guide see Timeline of association football On the left an episkyros player on an ancient stone carving c BCE exhibited at the National Archaeological Museum Athens on the right children playing cuju in Song dynasty China th century Kicking ball games arose independently multiple times across multiple cultures b The Chinese competitive game cuju literally kick ball also known as tsu chu resembles modern association football This is the earliest form of the game for which there is scientific evidence a military manual from the Han dynasty Cuju players could use any part of the body apart from hands and the intent was to kick a ball through an opening into a net During the Han dynasty BCE CE cuju games were standardised and rules were established The Silk Road facilitated the transmission of cuju especially the game popular in the Tang dynasty the period when the inflatable ball was invented and replaced the stuffed ball Other East Asian games included kemari in Japan and chukguk in Korea both influenced by cuju Kemari originated after the year during the Asuka period It was a ceremonial rather than a competitive game and involved the kicking of a mari a ball made of animal skin In North America pasuckuakohowog was a ball game played by the Algonquians it was described as almost identical to the kind of folk football being played in Europe at the same time in which the ball was kicked through goals Phaininda and episkyros were Greek ball games An image of an episkyros player depicted in low relief on a stele of c BCE in the National Archaeological Museum of Athens appears on the UEFA European Championship trophy Athenaeus writing in CE mentions the Roman ball game harpastum Phaininda episkyros and harpastum were played involving hands and violence They all appear to have resembled rugby football wrestling and volleyball more than what is recognisable as modern football As with precodified mob football the antecedent of all modern football codes these three games involved more handling the ball than kicking it Association football in itself does not have a classical history Notwithstanding any similarities to other ball games played around the world FIFA has described that no historical connection exists with any game played in antiquity outside Europe The history of football in England dates back to at least the eighth century The modern rules of association football are based on the midth century efforts to standardise the widely varying forms of football played in the public schools of England The Laws of the University Foot Ball Club Cambridge Rules of The Cambridge rules first drawn up at the University of Cambridge in were particularly influential in the development of subsequent codes including association football The Cambridge rules were written at Trinity College Cambridge at a meeting attended by representatives from Eton Harrow Rugby Winchester and Shrewsbury schools They were not universally adopted During the s many clubs unconnected to schools or universities were formed throughout the Englishspeaking world to play various forms of football Some came up with their own distinct codes of rules most notably the Sheffield Football Club formed by former public school pupils in which led to the formation of a Sheffield FA in In John Charles Thring of Uppingham School also devised an influential set of rules An early draft of the original handwritten Laws of the Game drawn up on behalf of The Football Association by Ebenezer Cobb Morley in on display at the National Football Museum Manchester England These ongoing efforts contributed to the formation of The Football Association The FA in which first met on the morning of October at the Freemasons Tavern in Great Queen Street London The only school to be represented on this occasion was Charterhouse The Freemasons Tavern was the setting for five more meetings of The FA between October and December the English FA eventually issued the first comprehensive set of rules named Laws of the Game forming modern football The laws included bans on running with the ball in hand and hacking kicking an opponent in the shins tripping and holding Eleven clubs under the charge of FA secretary Ebenezer Cobb Morley ratified the original thirteen laws of the game The sticking point was hacking which a twelfth club at the meeting Blackheath FC had wanted to keep resulting in them withdrawing from the FA Other English rugby clubs followed this lead and did not join the FA and instead in along with Blackheath formed the Rugby Football Union The FA rules included handling of the ball by marks and the lack of a crossbar rules which made it remarkably similar to Victorian rules football being developed at that time in Australia The Sheffield FA played by its own rules until the s with the FA absorbing some of its rules until there was little difference between the games The Aston Villa team in after winning both the FA Cup and the English Football League The worlds oldest football competition is the FA Cup which was founded by the footballer and cricketer Charles W Alcock and has been contested by English teams since The first official international football match also took place in between Scotland and England in Glasgow again at the instigation of Alcock England is also home to the worlds first football league which was founded in Birmingham in by Aston Villa director William McGregor The original format contained clubs from the Midlands and Northern England Laws of the Game are determined by the International Football Association Board IFAB The board was formed in after a meeting in Manchester of the Football Association the Scottish Football Association the Football Association of Wales and the Irish Football Association FIFA the international football body was formed in Paris in and declared that they would adhere to the Laws of the Game of the Football Association The growing popularity of the international game led to the admittance of FIFA representatives to the IFAB in The board consists of four representatives from FIFA and one representative from each of the four British associations For most of the th century Europe and South America were the dominant regions in association football The FIFA World Cup inaugurated in became the main stage for players of both continents to show their worth and the strength of their national teams In the second half of the century the European Cup and the Copa Libertadores were created and the champions of these two club competitions would contest the Intercontinental Cup to prove which team was the best in the world In the st century South America has continued to produce some of the best footballers in the world but its clubs have fallen behind the still dominant European clubs which often sign the best players from Latin America and elsewhere Meanwhile football has improved in Africa Asia and North America and nowadays these regions are at least on equal grounds with South America in club football although countries in the Caribbean and Oceania regions except Australia have yet to make a mark in international football When it comes to national teams however Europeans and South Americans continue to dominate the FIFA World Cup as no team from any other region has managed to even reach the final Football is played at a professional level all over the world Millions of people regularly go to football stadiums to follow their favourite teams while billions more watch the game on television or on the internet A very large number of people also play football at an amateur level According to a survey conducted by FIFA published in over million people from more than countries regularly play football Football has the highest global television audience in sport In many parts of the world football evokes great passions and plays an important role in the life of individual fans local communities and even nations Ryszard Kapuciski says that Europeans who are polite modest or humble fall easily into rage when playing or watching football games The Ivory Coast national football team helped secure a truce to the nations civil war in and it helped further reduce tensions between government and rebel forces in by playing a match in the rebel capital of Bouak an occasion that brought both armies together peacefully for the first time By contrast football is widely considered to have been the final proximate cause for the Football War in June between El Salvador and Honduras The sport also exacerbated tensions at the beginning of the Croatian War of Independence of the s when a match between Dinamo Zagreb and Red Star Belgrade degenerated into rioting in May Womens association football This section needs to be updated Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information October Main article Womens association football Womens association football has historically seen opposition with national associations severely curbing its development and several outlawing it completely Women may have been playing football for as long as the game has existed Evidence shows that a similar ancient game cuju or tsu chu was played by women during the Han dynasty CE as female figures are depicted in frescoes of the period playing tsu chu There are also reports of annual football matches played by women in Midlothian Scotland during the s North team of the British Ladies the first organised womens football team here pictured in March Association football the modern game has documented early involvement of women In football governing bodies introduced standardised rules to prohibit violence on the pitch making it more socially acceptable for women to play The first match recorded by the Scottish Football Association took place in in Glasgow In England the first recorded game of football between women took place in Womens football has traditionally been associated with charity games and physical exercise particularly in the United Kingdom Association football continued to be played by women since the time of the first recorded womens games in the late th century The bestdocumented early European team was founded by activist Nettie Honeyball in England in It was named the British Ladies Football Club Honeyball is quoted as I founded the association late last year with the fixed resolve of proving to the world that women are not the ornamental and useless creatures men have pictured I must confess my convictions on all matters where the sexes are so widely divided are all on the side of emancipation and I look forward to the time when ladies may sit in Parliament and have a voice in the direction of affairs especially those which concern them most Honeyball and those like her paved the way for womens football However the womens game was frowned upon by the British football associations and continued without their support It has been suggested that this was motivated by a perceived threat to the masculinity of the game Womens football became popular on a large scale at the time of the First World War when female employment in heavy industry spurred the growth of the game much as it had done for men years earlier The most successful team of the era was Dick Kerr Ladies FC of Preston England The team played in one of the first womens international matches against a French XI team in and also made up most of the England team against a Scottish Ladies XI in the same year winning Despite being more popular than some mens football events with one match seeing a strong crowd in womens football in England suffered a blow in when The Football Association outlawed the playing of the game on association members pitches stating that the game of football is quite unsuitable for females and should not be encouraged Players and football writers have argued that this ban was in fact due to envy of the large crowds that womens matches attracted and because the FA had no control over the money made from the womens game The FA ban led to the formation of the shortlived English Ladies Football Association and play moved to rugby grounds Womens football also faced bans in several other countries notably in Brazil from to in France from to and in Germany from to Young Finnish girls football team of Kolarin Kontio in Pite Sweden in Restrictions began to be reduced in the s and s The Italian womens football league was established in In December the Womens Football Association was formed in England with the sport eventually becoming the most prominent team sport for women in the United Kingdom Two unofficial womens World Cups were organised by the FIEFF in and in Also in Union of European Football Associations UEFA members voted to officially recognise womens football while The Football Association rescinded the ban that prohibited women from playing on association members pitches in England Womens football still faces many struggles but its worldwide growth has seen major competitions being launched at both the national and international levels mirroring the mens competitions The FIFA Womens World Cup was inaugurated in the first tournament was held in China featuring teams from the respective six confederations The World Cup has been held every four years since by the FIFA Womens World Cup in France it had expanded to national teams and billion viewers watched the competition Womens football has been an Olympic event since North America is the dominant region in womens football with the United States winning most FIFA Womens World Cups and Olympic tournaments Europe and Asia come second and third in terms of international success and the womens game has been improving in South America Gameplay See also Parkers Piece One half of a professional football match minutes between Slovenian clubs NK Nafta and NK Dob The score after the half is Association football is played in accordance with a set of rules known as the Laws of the Game The game is played using a spherical ball of cm in circumference known as the football or soccer ball Two teams of eleven players each compete to get the ball into the other teams goal between the posts and under the bar thereby scoring a goal The team that has scored more goals at the end of the game is the winner if both teams have scored an equal number of goals then the game is a draw Each team is led by a captain who has only one official responsibility as mandated by the Laws of the Game to represent their team in the coin toss before kickoff or penalty kicks The primary law is that players other than goalkeepers may not deliberately handle the ball with their hands or arms during play though they must use both their hands during a throwin restart Although players usually use their feet to move the ball around they may use any part of their body notably heading with the forehead other than their hands or arms Within normal play all players are free to play the ball in any direction and move throughout the pitch though players may not pass to teammates who are in an offside position During gameplay players attempt to create goalscoring opportunities through individual control of the ball such as by dribbling passing the ball to a teammate and by taking shots at the goal which is guarded by the opposing goalkeeper Opposing players may try to regain control of the ball by intercepting a pass or through tackling the opponent in possession of the ball however physical contact between opponents is restricted Football is generally a freeflowing game with play stopping only when the ball has left the field of play or when play is stopped by the referee for an infringement of the rules After a stoppage play recommences with a specified restart A player executing a slide tackle to dispossess an opponent At a professional level most matches produce only a few goals For example the season of the English Premier League produced an average of goals per match The Laws of the Game do not specify any player positions other than goalkeeper but a number of specialised roles have evolved Broadly these include three main categories strikers or forwards whose main task is to score goals defenders who specialise in preventing their opponents from scoring and midfielders who dispossess the opposition and keep possession of the ball to pass it to the forwards on their team Players in these positions are referred to as outfield players to distinguish them from the goalkeeper These positions are further subdivided according to the area of the field in which the player spends the most time For example there are central defenders and left and right midfielders The ten outfield players may be arranged in any combination The number of players in each position determines the style of the teams play more forwards and fewer defenders creates a more aggressive and offensiveminded game while the reverse creates a slower more defensive style of play While players typically spend most of the game in a specific position there are few restrictions on player movement and players can switch positions at any time The layout of a teams players is known as a formation Defining the teams formation and tactics is usually the prerogative of the teams manager Laws Rules of football redirects here For the rules of other football games see Football Further information Laws of the Game association football There are laws in the official Laws of the Game each containing a collection of stipulations and guidelines The same laws are designed to apply to all levels of football for both sexes although certain modifications for groups such as juniors seniors and people with physical disabilities are permitted c The laws are often framed in broad terms which allow flexibility in their application depending on the nature of the game The Laws of the Game are published by FIFA but are maintained by the IFAB In addition to the seventeen laws numerous IFAB decisions and other directives contribute to the regulation of association football Within the United States Major League Soccer used a distinct ruleset during the s and the National Federation of State High School Associations and National Collegiate Athletic Association still use rulesets that are comparable to but different from the IFAB Laws Players equipment and officials See also Association football positions Formation association football Substitute association football and Kit association football The referee officiates in a football match Each team consists of a maximum of eleven players excluding substitutes one of whom must be the goalkeeper Competition rules may state a minimum number of players required to constitute a team which is usually seven Goalkeepers are the only players allowed to play the ball with their hands or arms provided they do so within the penalty area in front of their own goal Though there are a variety of positions in which the outfield nongoalkeeper players are strategically placed by a coach these positions are not defined or required by the Laws The basic equipment or kit players are required to wear includes a shirt shorts socks footwear and adequate shin guards An athletic supporter and protective cup is highly recommended for male players by medical experts and professionals Headgear is not a required piece of basic equipment but players today may choose to wear it to protect themselves from head injury Players are forbidden to wear or use anything that is dangerous to themselves or another player such as jewellery or watches The goalkeeper must wear clothing that is easily distinguishable from that worn by the other players and the match officials A number of players may be replaced by substitutes during the course of the game The maximum number of substitutions permitted in most competitive international and domestic league games is five in minutes with each team being allowed one more if the game should go into extratime the permitted number may vary in other competitions or in friendly matches Common reasons for a substitution include injury tiredness ineffectiveness a tactical switch or timewasting at the end of a finely poised game In standard adult matches a player who has been substituted may not take further part in a match IFAB recommends that a match should not continue if there are fewer than seven players in either team Any decision regarding points awarded for abandoned games is left to the individual football associations A game is officiated by a referee who has full authority to enforce the Laws of the Game in connection with the match to which he has been appointed Law and whose decisions are final The referee is assisted by two assistant referees In many highlevel games there is also a fourth official who assists the referee and may replace another official should the need arise Goal line technology is used to measure if the whole ball has crossed the goalline thereby determining whether a goal has been scored or not this was brought in to prevent controversy Video assistant referees VAR have also been increasingly introduced in highlevel matches to assist officials through video replays to correct clear and obvious mistakes There are four types of calls that can be reviewed mistaken identity in awarding a red or yellow card goals and whether there was a violation during the buildup direct red card decisions and penalty decisions Ball Main article Ball association football The ball is spherical with a circumference of between and cm and in a weight in the range of to g to oz and a pressure between and standard atmospheres and pounds per square inch at sea level In the past the ball was made up of leather panels sewn together with a latex bladder for pressurisation but modern balls at all levels of the game are now synthetic Pitch Main article Football pitch Standard pitch measurements As the Laws were formulated in England and were initially administered solely by the four British football associations within IFAB the standard dimensions of a football pitch were originally expressed in imperial units The Laws now express dimensions with approximate metric equivalents followed by traditional units in brackets though use of imperial units remains popular in Englishspeaking countries with a relatively recent history of metrication or only partial metrication such as Britain The length of the pitch or field for international adult matches is in the range of m yd and the width is in the range of m yd Fields for noninternational matches may be m yd in length and m yd in width provided the pitch does not become square In the IFAB initially approved a fixed size of m yd long and m yd wide as a standard pitch dimension for international matches however this decision was later put on hold and was never actually implemented The longer boundary lines are touchlines while the shorter boundaries on which the goals are placed are goal lines A rectangular goal is positioned on each goal line midway between the two touchlines The inner edges of the vertical goal posts must be m ft apart and the lower edge of the horizontal crossbar supported by the goal posts must be m ft above the ground Nets are usually placed behind the goal but are not required by the Laws In front of the goal is the penalty area This area is marked by the goal line two lines starting on the goal line m yd from the goalposts and extending m yd into the pitch perpendicular to the goal line and a line joining them This area has a number of functions the most prominent being to mark where the goalkeeper may handle the ball and where a penalty foul by a member of the defending team becomes punishable by a penalty kick Other markings define the position of the ball or players at kickoffs goal kicks penalty kicks and corner kicks Duration and tiebreaking methods minute ordinary time A standard adult football match consists of two halves of minutes each Each half runs continuously meaning that the clock is not stopped when the ball is out of play There is usually a minute halftime break between halves The end of the match is known as fulltime The referee is the official timekeeper for the match and may make an allowance for time lost through substitutions injured players requiring attention or other stoppages This added time is called additional time in FIFA documents but is most commonly referred to as stoppage time or injury time while lost time can also be used as a synonym The duration of stoppage time is at the sole discretion of the referee Stoppage time does not fully compensate for the time in which the ball is out of play and a minute game typically involves about an hour of effective playing time The referee alone signals the end of the match In matches where a fourth official is appointed towards the end of the half the referee signals how many minutes of stoppage time they intend to add The fourth official then informs the players and spectators by holding up a board showing this number The signalled stoppage time may be further extended by the referee Added time was introduced because of an incident which happened in during a match between Stoke and Aston Villa Trailing with two minutes remaining Stoke were awarded a penalty kick Villas goalkeeper deliberately kicked the ball out of play by the time it was recovered the clock had run out and the game was over leaving Stoke unable to attempt the penalty The same law also states that the duration of either half is extended until a penalty kick to be taken or retaken is completed thus no game can end with an uncompleted penalty Tiebreaking Main article Determining the Outcome of a Match association football Most knockout competitions use a penalty shootout to decide the winner if a match ends as a draw In league competitions games may end in a draw In knockout competitions where a winner is required various methods may be employed to break such a deadlock some competitions may invoke replays A game tied at the end of regulation time may go into extra time which consists of two further minute periods If the score is still tied after extra time some competitions allow the use of penalty shootouts known officially in the Laws of the Game as kicks from the penalty mark to determine which team will progress to the next stage of the tournament or be the champion Goals scored during extra time periods count towards the final score of the game but kicks from the penalty mark are only used to decide the team that progresses to the next part of the tournament with goals scored in a penalty shootout not making up part of the final score In competitions using twolegged matches each team competes at home once with an aggregate score from the two matches deciding which team progresses Where aggregates are equal the away goals rule may be used to determine the winners in which case the winner is the team that scored the most goals in the leg they played away from home If the result is still equal extra time and potentially a penalty shootout are required Ball in and out of play Main article Ball in and out of play A player takes a free kick while the opposition form a wall to try to block the ball Under the Laws the two basic states of play during a game are ball in play and ball out of play From the beginning of each playing period with a kickoff until the end of the playing period the ball is in play at all times except when either the ball leaves the field of play or play is stopped by the referee When the ball becomes out of play play is restarted by one of eight restart methods depending on how it went out of play Kickoff following a goal by the opposing team or to begin each period of play Throwin when the ball has crossed the touchline awarded to the opposing team to that which last touched the ball Goal kick when the ball has wholly crossed the goal line without a goal having been scored and having last been touched by a player of the attacking team awarded to defending team Corner kick when the ball has wholly crossed the goal line without a goal having been scored and having last been touched by a player of the defending team awarded to attacking team Indirect free kick awarded to the opposing team following nonpenal fouls certain technical infringements or when play is stopped to caution or dismiss an opponent without a specific foul having occurred A goal may not be scored directly without the ball first touching another player from an indirect free kick Direct free kick awarded to fouled team following certain listed penal fouls A goal may be scored directly from a direct free kick Penalty kick awarded to the fouled team following a foul usually punishable by a direct free kick but that has occurred within their opponents penalty area Droppedball occurs when the referee has stopped play for any other reason such as a serious injury to a player interference by an external party or a ball becoming defective Misconduct Main article Foul association football Onfield Players are cautioned with a yellow card and dismissed from the game with a red card These colours were first introduced at the FIFA World Cup and used consistently since A foul occurs when a player commits an offence listed in the Laws of the Game while the ball is in play The offences that constitute a foul are listed in Law Handling the ball deliberately tripping an opponent or pushing an opponent are examples of penal fouls punishable by a direct free kick or penalty kick depending on where the offence occurred Other fouls are punishable by an indirect free kick The referee may punish a players or substitutes misconduct by a caution yellow card or dismissal red card A second yellow card in the same game leads to a red card which results in a dismissal A player given a yellow card is said to have been booked the referee writing the players name in their official notebook If a player has been dismissed no substitute can be brought on in their place and the player may not participate in further play Misconduct may occur at any time and while the offences that constitute misconduct are listed the definitions are broad In particular the offence of unsporting behaviour may be used to deal with most events that violate the spirit of the game even if they are not listed as specific offences A referee can show a yellow or red card to a player substitute substituted player and to nonplayers such as managers and support staff Rather than stopping play the referee may allow play to continue if doing so will benefit the team against which an offence has been committed This is known as playing an advantage The referee may call back play and penalise the original offence if the anticipated advantage does not ensue within a few seconds Even if an offence is not penalised due to advantage being played the offender may still be sanctioned for misconduct at the next stoppage of play The referees decision in all onpitch matters is considered final The score of a match cannot be altered after the game even if later evidence shows that decisions including awardsnonawards of goals were incorrect Offfield See also Foul association football Postmatch Along with the general administration of the sport football associations and competition organisers also enforce good conduct in wider aspects of the game dealing with issues such as comments to the press clubs financial management doping age fraud and match fixing Most competitions enforce mandatory suspensions for players who are sent off in a game Some onfield incidents if considered very serious such as allegations of racial abuse may result in competitions deciding to impose heavier sanctions than those normally associated with a red card d Some associations allow for appeals against player suspensions incurred onfield if clubs feel a referee was incorrect or unduly harsh Sanctions for such infractions may be levied on individuals or on clubs as a whole Penalties may include fines point deductions in league competitions or even expulsion from competitions For example the English Football League deduct points from any team that enters financial administration Among other administrative sanctions are penalties against game forfeiture Teams that had forfeited a game or had been forfeited against would be awarded a technical loss or win Governing bodies See

competitions Main article List of association football competitions The FIFA World Cup is the largest international competition in football and the worlds most viewed sporting event International competitions in association football principally consist of two varieties competitions involving representative national teams or those involving clubs based in multiple nations and national leagues International football without qualification most often refers to the former In the case of international club competition it is the country of origin of the clubs involved not the nationalities of their players that renders the competition international in nature The major international competition in football is the World Cup organised by FIFA This competition has taken place every four years since with the exception of the and tournaments which were cancelled because of World War II As of over national teams compete in qualifying tournaments within the scope of continental confederations for a place in the finals The finals tournament held every four years involved national teams expanding to teams for the tournament competing over a fourweek period e The World Cup is the most prestigious association football tournament as well as the most widely viewed and followed sporting event in the world exceeding even the Olympic Games the cumulative audience of all matches of the FIFA World Cup was estimated to be billion with an estimated million people watching the final match oneninth of the entire population of the planet The World Cup saw the emergence of Pel as a global sporting star a period that coincided with the explosive spread of television which massively amplified his presence everywhere The current champions are Argentina who won their third title at the tournament in Qatar The FIFA Womens World Cup has been held every four years since Under the tournaments current format that was expanded in national teams vie for slots in a threeyear qualification phase while the host nations team enters automatically as the nd slot The current champions are Spain after winning their first title in the tournament There has been a football tournament at every Summer Olympic Games since except at the games in Los Angeles when FIFA and the IOC had disagreed over the status of amateur players Before the inception of the World Cup the Olympics especially during the s were the most prestigious international event Originally the tournament was for amateurs only As professionalism spread around the world the gap in quality between the World Cup and the Olympics widened The countries that benefited most were the Soviet Bloc countries of Eastern Europe where top athletes were statesponsored while retaining their status as amateurs Between and out of Olympic medals were won by Eastern Europe with only Sweden gold in and bronze in Denmark bronze in and silver in and Japan bronze in breaking their dominance For the Los Angeles Games the IOC allowed professional players to compete Since male competitors must be under years old although since three players over the age of have been allowed per squad A womens tournament was added in in contrast to the mens event full international sides without age restrictions play the womens Olympic tournament Spanish footballers Fernando Torres Juan Mata and Sergio Ramos celebrating winning the UEFA European Championship in After the World Cup the most important international football competitions are the continental championships which are organised by each continental confederation and contested between national teams These are the European Championship UEFA the Copa Amrica CONMEBOL the African Cup of Nations CAF the Asian Cup AFC the CONCACAF Gold Cup CONCACAF and the OFC Nations Cup OFC These competitions are not strictly limited to members of the continental confederations with guest teams from other continents sometimes invited to compete The FIFA Confederations Cup was contested by the winners of all six continental championships the current FIFA World Cup champions and the country which was hosting the next World Cup This was generally regarded as a warmup tournament for the upcoming FIFA World Cup and did not carry the same prestige as the World Cup itself The tournament was discontinued following the edition with its calendar slot replaced by an expanded FIFA Club World Cup The UEFA Nations League and the CONCACAF Nations League were introduced in the late s to replace international friendlies during the twoyear cycle between major tournaments The most prestigious competitions in club football are the respective continental championships which are generally contested between national champions for example the UEFA Champions League in Europe and the Copa Libertadores in South America The winners of each continental competition contest the FIFA Club World Cup Domestic competitions Main articles Geography of association football and Geography of womens association football A Spanish La Liga match between Real Madrid and Barcelona The fixture known as El Clsico is one of the most renowned in sport The governing bodies in each country operate league systems in a domestic season normally comprising several divisions in which the teams gain points throughout the season depending on results Teams are placed into tables placing them in order according to points accrued Most commonly each team plays every other team in its league at home and away in each season in a roundrobin tournament At the end of a season the top team is declared the champion The top few teams may be promoted to a higher division and one or more of the teams finishing at the bottom are relegated to a lower division The teams finishing at the top of a countrys league may also be eligible to play in international club competitions in the following season The main exceptions to this system occur in some Latin American leagues which divide football championships into two sections named Apertura and Clausura Spanish for Opening and Closing awarding a champion for each Most countries supplement the league system with one or more cup competitions organised on a knockout basis These include the domestic cup which may be open to all eligible teams in a countrys league systemboth professional and amateurand is organised by the national federation Some countries top divisions feature highlypaid star players in smaller countries lower divisions and many womens clubs players may be parttimers with a second job or amateurs The five top European leagues Premier League England Bundesliga Germany La Liga Spain Serie A Italy and Ligue France attract most of the worlds best players and during the season each of these leagues had a total wage cost in excess of million needs update These leagues also generated a combined billion in revenue in the season from television contracts matchday tickets sponsorships and other sources See also Sports

Cricket is a batandball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the centre of which is a yard metre pitch with a wicket at each end each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps Two players from the batting team the striker and nonstriker stand in front of either wicket with one player from the fielding team the bowler bowling the ball towards the strikers wicket from the opposite end of the pitch The strikers goal is to hit the bowled ball and then switch places with the nonstriker with the batting team scoring one run for each exchange Runs are also scored when the ball reaches or crosses the boundary of the field or when the ball is bowled illegally The fielding team tries to prevent runs from being scored by dismissing batters so they are out Means of dismissal include being bowled when the ball hits the strikers wicket and dislodges the bails and by the fielding side either catching the ball after it is hit by the bat but before it hits the ground or hitting a wicket with the ball before a batter can cross the crease in front of the wicket When ten batters have been dismissed the innings ends and the teams swap roles The game is adjudicated by two umpires aided by a third umpire and match referee in international matches They communicate with two offfield scorers who record the matchs statistical information Forms of cricket range from Twenty also known as T with each team batting for a single innings of overs each over being a set of fair opportunities for the batting team to score and the game generally lasting three to four hours to Test matches played over five days Traditionally cricketers play in allwhite kit but in limited overs cricket they wear club or team colours In addition to the basic kit some players wear protective gear to prevent injury caused by the ball which is a hard solid spheroid made of compressed leather with a slightly raised sewn seam enclosing a cork core layered with tightly wound string The earliest known definite reference to cricket is to it being played in South East England in the midth century It spread globally with the expansion of the British Empire with the first international matches in the second half of the th century The games governing body is the International Cricket Council ICC which has over members twelve of which are full members who play Test matches The games rules the Laws of Cricket are maintained by Marylebone Cricket Club MCC in London The sport is followed primarily in South Asia Australia New Zealand the United Kingdom Southern Africa and the West Indies Womens cricket which is organised and played separately has also achieved international standard The most successful side playing international cricket is Australia which has won eight One Day International trophies including six World Cups more than any other country and has been the toprated Test side more than any other country citation needed History Main article History of cricket Origins Main article History of cricket to A medieval club ball game involving an underarm bowl towards a batter Ball catchers are shown positioning themselves to catch a ball Detail from the Canticles of Holy Mary th century Cricket is one of many games in the club ball sphere that basically involve hitting a ball with a handheld implement others include baseball which shares many similarities with cricket both belonging in the more specific batandball games category golf hockey tennis squash badminton and table tennis In crickets case a key difference is the existence of a solid target structure the wicket originally it is thought a wicket gate through which sheep were herded that the batter must defend The cricket historian Harry Altham identified three groups of club ball games the hockey group in which the ball is driven to and from between two targets the goals the golf group in which the ball is driven towards an undefended target the hole and the cricket group in which the ball is aimed at a mark the wicket and driven away from it It is generally believed that cricket originated as a childrens game in the southeastern counties of England sometime during the medieval period Although there are claims for prior dates the earliest definite reference to cricket being played comes from evidence given at a court case in Guildford in January Old Style equating to January in the modern calendar The case concerned ownership of a certain plot of land and the court heard the testimony of a yearold coroner John Derrick who gave witness that Being a scholler in the ffree schoole of Guldeford hee and diverse of his fellows did runne and play there at creckett and other plaies Given Derricks age it was about half a century earlier when he was at school and so it is certain that cricket was being played c by boys in Surrey The view that it was originally a childrens game is reinforced by Randle Cotgrave s EnglishFrench dictionary in which he defined the noun crosse as the crooked staff wherewith boys play at cricket and the verb form crosser as to play at cricket One possible source for the sports name is the Old English word cryce or cricc meaning a crutch or staff In Samuel Johnson s Dictionary he derived cricket from cryce Saxon a stick In Old French the word criquet seems to have meant a kind of club or stick Given the strong medieval trade connections between southeast England and the County of Flanders when the latter belonged to the Duchy of Burgundy the name may have been derived from the Middle Dutch in use in Flanders at the time krick e meaning a stick crook Another possible source is the Middle Dutch word krickstoel meaning a long low stool used for kneeling in church and which resembled the long low wicket with two stumps used in early cricket According to Heiner Gillmeister a European language expert of Bonn University cricket derives from the Middle Dutch phrase for hockey met de krik ketsen ie with the stick chase Gillmeister has suggested that not only the name but also the sport itself may be of Flemish origin Growth of amateur and professional cricket in England Evolution of the cricket bat The original hockey stick left evolved into the straight bat from c when pitched delivery bowling began Although the main object of the game has always been to score the most runs the early form of cricket differed from the modern game in certain key technical aspects the North American variant of cricket known as wicket retained many of these aspects The ball was bowled underarm by the bowler and along the ground towards a batter armed with a bat that in shape resembled a hockey stick the batter defended a low twostump wicket and runs were called notches because the scorers recorded them by notching tally sticks In the year Cotgraves dictionary was published ecclesiastical court records at Sidlesham in Sussex state that two parishioners Bartholomew Wyatt and Richard Latter failed to attend church on Easter Sunday because they were playing cricket They were fined d each and ordered to do penance This is the earliest mention of adult participation in cricket and it was around the same time that the earliest known organised interparish or village match was played at Chevening Kent In a player called Jasper Vinall died after he was accidentally struck on the head during a match between two parish teams in Sussex Cricket remained a lowkey local pursuit for much of the th century It is known through numerous references found in the records of ecclesiastical court cases to have been proscribed at times by the Puritans before and during the Commonwealth The problem was nearly always the issue of Sunday play as the Puritans considered cricket to be profane if played on the Sabbath especially if large crowds or gambling were involved According to the social historian Derek Birley there was a great upsurge of sport after the Restoration in Several members of the court of King Charles II took a strong interest in cricket during that era Gambling on sport became a problem significant enough for Parliament to pass the Gambling Act limiting stakes to which was in any case a colossal sum exceeding the annual income of of the population Along with horse racing as well as prizefighting and other types of blood sport cricket was perceived to be a gambling sport Rich patrons made matches for high stakes forming teams in which they engaged the first professional players By the end of the century cricket had developed into a major sport that was spreading throughout England and was already being taken abroad by English mariners and colonisers the earliest reference to cricket overseas is dated A newspaper report survives of a great cricket match played in Sussex for fifty guineas apiece this is the earliest known contest that is generally considered a First Class match The patrons and other players from the social class known as the gentry began to classify themselves as amateurs fn to establish a clear distinction from the professionals who were invariably members of the working class even to the point of having separate changing and dining facilities The gentry including such highranking nobles as the Dukes of Richmond exerted their honour code of noblesse oblige to claim rights of leadership in any sporting contests they took part in especially as it was necessary for them to play alongside their social inferiors if they were to win their bets In time a perception took hold that the typical amateur who played in firstclass cricket until when amateurism was abolished was someone with a public school education who had then gone to one of Cambridge or Oxford University society insisted that such people were officers and gentlemen whose destiny was to provide leadership In a purely financial sense the cricketing amateur would theoretically claim expenses for playing while his professional counterpart played under contract and was paid a wage or match fee in practice many amateurs claimed more than actual expenditure and the derisive term shamateur was coined to describe the practice English cricket in the th and th centuries Francis Cotes The Young Cricketer The game underwent major development in the th century to become Englands national sport Its success was underwritten by the twin necessities of patronage and betting Cricket was prominent in London as early as and in the middle years of the century large crowds flocked to matches on the Artillery Ground in Finsbury citation needed The single wicket form of the sport attracted huge crowds and wagers to match its popularity peaking in the season Bowling underwent an evolution around when bowlers began to pitch the ball instead of rolling or skimming it towards the batter This caused a revolution in bat design because to deal with the bouncing ball it was necessary to introduce the modern straight bat in place of the old hockey stick shape citation needed The Hambledon Club was founded in the s and for the next twenty years until the formation of Marylebone Cricket Club MCC and the opening of Lords Old Ground in Hambledon was both the games greatest club and its focal point citation needed MCC quickly became the sports premier club and the custodian of the Laws of Cricket New Laws introduced in the latter part of the th century included the three stump wicket and leg before wicket lbw The th century saw underarm bowling superseded by first roundarm and then overarm bowling Both developments were controversial Organisation of the game at county level led to the creation of the county clubs starting with Sussex in In December the eight leading county clubs formed the official County Championship which began in The first recorded photo of a cricket match taken on July by Roger Fenton The most famous player of the th century was W G Grace who started his long and influential career in It was especially during the career of Grace that the distinction between amateurs and professionals became blurred by the existence of players like him who were nominally amateur but in terms of their financial gain de facto professional Grace himself was said to have been paid more money for playing cricket than any professional citation needed The last two decades before the First World War have been called the Golden Age of cricket It is a nostalgic name prompted by the collective sense of loss resulting from the war but the period did produce some great players and memorable matches especially as organised competition at county and Test level developed Cricket becomes an international sport The first English team to tour overseas on board ship to North America In the firstever international match took place between what were essentially club teams from the United States and Canada in Toronto Canada won In a team of English players went to North America on the first overseas tour Meanwhile the British Empire had been instrumental in spreading the game overseas and by the middle of the th century it had become well established in Australia the Caribbean British India which includes presentday Pakistan and Bangladesh New Zealand North America and South Africa In an English team made the first tour of Australia The first Australian team to travel overseas consisted of Aboriginal stockmen which toured England in In an England team took part in what was retrospectively recognized as the firstever Test match at the Melbourne Cricket Ground against Australia The rivalry between England and Australia gave birth to The Ashes in and this has remained Test crickets most famous contest Test cricket began to expand in when South Africa played England World cricket in the th century Don Bradman of Australia had a record Test batting average of The interwar years were dominated by Australia s Don Bradman statistically the greatest Test batter of all time Test cricket continued to expand during the th century with the addition of the West Indies New Zealand and India before the Second World War and then Pakistan Sri Lanka Zimbabwe Bangladesh Ireland and Afghanistan both in the postwar period South Africa was banned from international cricket from to as part of the apartheid boycott The rise of limited overs cricket Cricket entered a new era in when English counties introduced the limited overs variant As it was sure to produce a result limited overs cricket was lucrative and the number of matches increased The first Limited Overs International was played in and the governing International Cricket Council ICC seeing its potential staged the first limited overs Cricket World Cup in In the st century a new limited overs form Twenty made an immediate impact citation needed On June Afghanistan and Ireland became the th and th ICC full members enabling them to play Test cricket Laws and gameplay Main article Laws of Cricket A typical cricket field In cricket the rules of the game are specified in a code called The Laws of Cricket hereinafter called the Laws which has a global remit There are Laws always written with a capital L The earliest known version of the code was drafted in and since it has been owned and maintained by its custodian the Marylebone Cricket Club MCC in London Playing area Main articles Cricket field Cricket pitch Crease cricket and Wicket Cricket is a batandball game played on a cricket field see image of cricket pitch and creases between two teams of eleven players each The field is usually circular or oval in shape and the edge of the playing area is marked by a boundary which may be a fence part of the stands a rope a painted line or a combination of these the boundary must if possible be marked along its entire length In the approximate centre of the field is a rectangular pitch see image below on which a wooden target called a wicket is sited at each end the wickets are placed yards m apart The pitch is a flat surface feet m wide with very short grass that tends to be worn away as the game progresses cricket can also be played on artificial surfaces notably matting Each wicket is made of three wooden stumps topped by two bails Cricket pitch and creases As illustrated the pitch is marked at each end with four white painted lines a bowling crease a popping crease and two return creases The three stumps are aligned centrally on the bowling crease which is eight feet eight inches long The popping crease is drawn four feet in front of the bowling crease and parallel to it although it is drawn as a twelvefoot line six feet either side of the wicket it is in fact unlimited in length The return creases are drawn at right angles to the popping crease so that they intersect the ends of the bowling crease each return crease is drawn as an eightfoot line so that it extends four feet behind the bowling crease but is also in fact unlimited in length Match structure and closure Main articles Innings and Result cricket A modern SG cricket bat back view Before a match begins the team captains who are also players toss a coin to decide which team will bat first and so take the first innings Innings is the term used for each phase of play in the match In each innings one team bats attempting to score runs while the other team bowls and fields the ball attempting to restrict the scoring and dismiss the batters When the first innings ends the teams change roles there can be two to four innings depending upon the type of match A match with four scheduled innings is played over three to five days a match with two scheduled innings is usually completed in a single day During an innings all eleven members of the fielding team take the field but usually only two members of the batting team are on the field at any given time The exception to this is if a batter has any type of illness or injury restricting his or her ability to run in this case the batter is allowed a runner who can run between the wickets when the batter hits a scoring run or runs though this does not apply in international cricket The order of batters is usually announced just before the match but it can be varied The main objective of each team is to score more runs than their opponents but in some forms of cricket it is also necessary to dismiss all of the opposition batters in their final innings in order to win the match which would otherwise be drawn If the team batting last is all out having scored fewer runs than their opponents they are said to have lost by n runs where n is the difference between the aggregate number of runs scored by the teams If the team that bats last scores enough runs to win it is said to have won by n wickets where n is the number of wickets left to fall For example a team that passes its opponents total having lost six wickets ie six of their batters have been dismissed have won the match by four wickets In a twoinningsaside match one teams combined first and second innings total may be less than the other sides first innings total The team with the greater score is then said to have won by an innings and n runs and does not need to bat again n is the difference between the two teams aggregate scores If the team batting last is all out and both sides have scored the same number of runs then the match is a tie this result is quite rare in matches of two innings a side with only happening in firstclass matches from the earliest known instance in until January In the traditional form of the game if the time allotted for the match expires before either side can win then the game is declared a draw If the match has only a single innings per side then usually a maximum number of overs applies to each innings Such a match is called a limited overs or oneday match and the side scoring more runs wins regardless of the number of wickets lost so that a draw cannot occur In some cases ties are broken by having each team bat for a oneover innings known as a Super Over subsequent Super Overs may be played if the first Super Over ends in a tie If this kind of match is temporarily interrupted by bad weather then a complex mathematical formula known as the DuckworthLewisStern method after its developers is often used to recalculate a new target score A oneday match can also be declared a noresult if fewer than a previously agreed number of overs have been bowled by either team in circumstances that make normal resumption of play impossible for example wet weather In all forms of cricket the umpires can abandon the match if bad light or rain makes it impossible to continue There have been instances of entire matches even Test matches scheduled to be played over five days being lost to bad weather without a ball being bowled for example the third Test of the series in Australia Innings Main article Innings The innings ending with s in both singular and plural form is the term used for each phase of play during a match Depending on the type of match being played each team has either one or two innings Sometimes all eleven members of the batting side take a turn to bat but for various reasons an innings can end before they have all done so The innings terminates if the batting team is all out a term defined by the Laws at the fall of a wicket or the retirement of a batter further balls remain to be bowled but no further batter is available to come in In this situation one of the batters has not been dismissed and is termed not out this is because he has no partners left and there must always be two active batters while the innings is in progress An innings may end early while there are still two not out batters the batting teams captain may declare the innings closed even though some of his players have not had a turn to bat this is a tactical decision by the captain usually because he believes his team have scored sufficient runs and need time to dismiss the opposition in their innings the set number of overs ie in a limited overs match have been bowled the match has ended prematurely due to bad weather or running out of time in the final innings of the match the batting side has reached its target and won the game Overs Main article Over cricket The Laws state that throughout an innings the ball shall be bowled from each end alternately in overs of balls The name over came about because the umpire calls Over when six balls have been bowled At this point another bowler is deployed at the other end and the fielding side changes ends while the batters do not A bowler cannot bowl two successive overs although a bowler can and usually does bowl alternate overs from the same end for several overs which are termed a spell The batters do not change ends at the end of the over and so the one who was nonstriker is now the striker and vice versa The umpires also change positions so that the one who was at square leg now stands behind the wicket at the nonstrikers end and vice versa Clothing and equipment Main article Cricket clothing and equipment English cricketer W G Grace taking guard in His pads and bat are very similar to those used today The gloves have evolved somewhat Many modern players use more defensive equipment than were available to Grace most notably helmets and arm guards The wicketkeeper a specialised fielder behind the batter and the batters wear protective gear because of the hardness of the ball which can be delivered at speeds of more than kilometres per hour mph and presents a major health and safety concern Protective clothing includes pads designed to protect the knees and shins batting gloves or wicketkeepers gloves for the hands a safety helmet for the head and a box for male players inside the trousers to protect the crotch area Some batters wear additional padding inside their shirts and trousers such as thigh pads arm pads rib protectors and shoulder pads The only fielders allowed to wear protective gear are those in positions very close to the batter ie if they are alongside or in front of him but they cannot wear gloves or external leg guards Subject to certain variations onfield clothing generally includes a collared shirt with short or long sleeves long trousers woolen pullover if needed cricket cap for fielding or a safety helmet and spiked shoes or boots to increase traction The kit is traditionally all white and this remains the case in Test and firstclass cricket but in limited overs cricket team colours are worn instead Bat and ball Main articles Cricket bat and Cricket ball Two types of cricket ball both of the same size i A used white ball White balls are mainly used in limited overs cricket especially in matches played at night under floodlights left ii A used red ball Red balls are used in Test cricket firstclass cricket and some other forms of cricket right The essence of the sport is that a bowler delivers ie bowls the ball from his or her end of the pitch towards the batter who armed with a bat is on strike at the other end see next subsection Basic gameplay The bat is made of wood usually Salix alba white willow and has the shape of a blade topped by a cylindrical handle The blade must not be more than inches cm wide and the total length of the bat not more than inches cm There is no standard for the weight which is usually between lb oz and lb and kg The ball is a hard leatherseamed spheroid with a circumference of inches cm The ball has a seam six rows of stitches attaching the leather shell of the ball to the string and cork interior The seam on a new ball is prominent and helps the bowler propel it in a less predictable manner During matches the quality of the ball deteriorates to a point where it is no longer usable during the course of this deterioration its behaviour in flight will change and can influence the outcome of the match Players will therefore attempt to modify the balls behaviour by modifying its physical properties Polishing the ball and wetting it with sweat or saliva is legal even when the polishing is deliberately done on one side only to increase the balls swing through the air but the acts of rubbing other substances into the ball scratching the surface or picking at the seam are illegal ball tampering Player roles Basic gameplay bowler to batter During normal play thirteen players and two umpires are on the field Two of the players are batters and the rest are all eleven members of the fielding team The other nine players in the batting team are off the field in the pavilion The image with overlay below shows what is happening when a ball is being bowled and which of the personnel are on or close to the pitch Umpire Wicket Nonstriking batter Bowler Ball Pitch Popping crease Striking batter Wicket Wicketkeeper First slip Return crease In the photo the two batters wearing yellow have taken position at each end of the pitch Three members of the fielding team wearing dark blue are in shot One of the two umpires wearing white hat is stationed behind the wicket at the bowlers end of the pitch The bowler is bowling the ball from his end of the pitch to the batter at the other end who is called the striker The other batter at the bowling end is called the nonstriker The wicketkeeper who is a specialist is positioned behind the strikers wicket and behind him stands one of the fielders in a position called first slip While the bowler and the first slip are wearing conventional kit only the two batters and the wicketkeeper are wearing protective gear including safety helmets padded gloves and leg guards pads While the umpire in shot stands at the bowlers end of the pitch his colleague stands in the outfield usually in or near the fielding position called square leg so that he is in line with the popping crease at the strikers end of the pitch The bowling crease not numbered is the one on which the wicket is located between the return creases The bowler intends to hit the wicket with the ball or at least to prevent the striker from scoring runs The striker intends by using his bat to defend his wicket and if possible to hit the ball away from the pitch in order to score runs Some players are skilled in both batting and bowling or as either of these as well as wicketkeeping so are termed allrounders Bowlers are classified according to their style generally as fast bowlers seam bowlers or spinners Batters are classified according to whether they are righthanded or lefthanded Fielding Main article Fielding cricket Fielding positions in cricket for a righthanded batter Of the eleven fielders three are in shot in the image above The other eight are elsewhere on the field their positions determined on a tactical basis by the captain or the bowler Fielders often change position between deliveries again as directed by the captain or bowler If a fielder is injured or becomes ill during a match a substitute is allowed to field instead of him but the substitute cannot bowl or act as a captain except in the case of concussion substitutes in international cricket The substitute leaves the field when the injured player is fit to return The Laws of Cricket were updated in to allow substitutes to act as wicketkeepers Bowling and dismissal Main articles Bowling cricket and Dismissal cricket Glenn McGrath of Australia holds the world record for most wickets in the Cricket World Cup Most bowlers are considered specialists in that they are selected for the team because of their skill as a bowler although some are allrounders and even specialist batters bowl occasionally The specialists bowl several times during an innings but may not bowl two overs consecutively If the captain wants a bowler to change ends another bowler must temporarily fill in so that the change is not immediate A bowler reaches his delivery stride by means of a runup and an over is deemed to have begun when the bowler starts his runup for the first delivery of that over the ball then being in play Fast bowlers needing momentum take a lengthy run up while bowlers with a slow delivery take no more than a couple of steps before bowling The fastest bowlers can deliver the ball at a speed of over kilometres per hour mph and they sometimes rely on sheer speed to try to defeat the batter who is forced to react very quickly Other fast bowlers rely on a mixture of speed and guile by making the ball seam or swing ie curve in flight This type of delivery can deceive a batter into miscuing his shot for example so that the ball just touches the edge of the bat and can then be caught behind by the wicketkeeper or a slip fielder At the other end of the bowling scale is the spin bowler who bowls at a relatively slow pace and relies entirely on guile to deceive the batter A spinner will often buy his wicket by tossing one up in a slower steeper parabolic path to lure the batter into making a poor shot The batter has to be very wary of such deliveries as they are often flighted or spun so that the ball will not behave quite as he expects and he could be trapped into getting himself out In between the pacemen and the spinners are the medium paced seamers who rely on persistent accuracy to try to contain the rate of scoring and wear down the batters concentration There are nine ways in which a batter can be dismissed five relatively common and four extremely rare The common forms of dismissal are bowled caught leg before wicket lbw run out and stumped Rare methods are hit wicket hit the ball twice obstructing the field and timed out The Laws state that the fielding team usually the bowler in practice must appeal for a dismissal before the umpire can give his decision If the batter is out the umpire raises a forefinger and says Out otherwise he will shake his head and say Not out There is effectively a tenth method of dismissal retired out which is not an onfield dismissal as such but rather a retrospective one for which no fielder is credited Batting runs and extras Main articles Batting cricket Run cricket and Extra cricket The directions in which a righthanded batter facing down the page intends to send the ball when playing various cricketing shots The diagram for a lefthanded batter is a mirror image of this one Batters take turns to bat via a batting order which is decided beforehand by the team captain and presented to the umpires though the order remains flexible when the captain officially nominates the team Substitute batters are generally not allowed except in the case of concussion substitutes in international cricket In order to begin batting the batter first adopts a batting stance Standardly this involves adopting a slight crouch with the feet pointing across the front of the wicket looking in the direction of the bowler and holding the bat so it passes over the feet and so its tip can rest on the ground near to the toes of the back foot A skilled batter can use a wide array of shots or strokes in both defensive and attacking mode The idea is to hit the ball to the best effect with the flat surface of the bats blade If the ball touches the side of the bat it is called an edge The batter does not have to play a shot and can allow the ball to go through to the wicketkeeper Equally he does not have to attempt a run when he hits the ball with his bat Batters do not always seek to hit the ball as hard as possible and a good player can score runs just by making a deft stroke with a turn of the wrists or by simply blocking the ball but directing it away from fielders so that he has time to take a run A wide variety of shots are played the batters repertoire including strokes named according to the style of swing and the direction aimed eg cut drive hook pull The batter on strike ie the striker must prevent the ball hitting the wicket and try to score runs by hitting the ball with his bat so that he and his partner have time to run from one end of the pitch to the other before the fielding side can return the ball To register a run both runners must touch the ground behind the popping crease with either their bats or their bodies the batters carry their bats as they run Each completed run increments the score of both the team and the striker Sachin Tendulkar is the only player to have scored one hundred international centuries The decision to attempt a run is ideally made by the batter who has the better view of the balls progress and this is communicated by calling usually yes no or wait More than one run can be scored from a single hit hits worth one to three runs are common but the size of the field is such that it is usually difficult to run four or more To compensate for this hits that reach the boundary of the field are automatically awarded four runs if the ball touches the ground en route to the boundary or six runs if the ball clears the boundary without touching the ground within the boundary In these cases the batters do not need to run Hits for five are unusual and generally rely on the help of overthrows by a fielder returning the ball If an odd number of runs is scored by the striker the two batters have changed ends and the one who was nonstriker is now the striker Only the striker can score individual runs but all runs are added to the teams total Additional runs can be gained by the batting team as extras called sundries in Australia due to errors made by the fielding side This is achieved in four ways noball a penalty of one extra conceded by the bowler if he breaks the rules wide a penalty of one extra conceded by the bowler if he bowls so that the ball is out of the batters reach bye an extra awarded if the batter misses the ball and it goes past the wicketkeeper and gives the batters time to run in the conventional way leg bye as for a bye except that the ball has hit the batters body though not his bat If the bowler has conceded a noball or a wide his team incurs an additional penalty because that ball ie delivery has to be bowled again and hence the batting side has the opportunity to score more runs from this extra ball Specialist roles Main articles Captain cricket and Wicketkeeper The captain is often the most experienced player in the team certainly the most tactically astute and can possess any of the main skillsets as a batter a bowler or a wicketkeeper Within the Laws the captain has certain responsibilities in terms of nominating his players to the umpires before the match and ensuring that his players conduct themselves within the spirit and traditions of the game as well as within the Laws The wicketkeeper sometimes called simply the keeper is a specialist fielder subject to various rules within the Laws about his equipment and demeanour He is the only member of the fielding side who can effect a stumping and is the only one permitted to wear gloves and external leg guards Depending on their primary skills the other ten players in the team tend to be classified as specialist batters or specialist bowlers Generally a team will include five or six specialist batters and four or five specialist bowlers plus the wicketkeeper Umpires and scorers Main articles Umpire cricket Scoring cricket and Cricket statistics An umpire signals a decision to the scorers The Adelaide Oval cricket scoreboard during an Ashes Test in Australia The game on the field is regulated by the two umpires one of whom stands behind the wicket at the bowlers end the other in a position called square leg which is about metres away from the batter on strike and in line with the popping crease on which he is taking guard The umpires have several responsibilities including adjudication on whether a ball has been correctly bowled ie not a noball or a wide when a run is scored whether a batter is out the fielding side must first appeal to the umpire usually with the phrase Hows that or Owzat when intervals start and end and the suitability of the pitch field and weather for playing the game The umpires are authorised to interrupt or even abandon a match due to circumstances likely to endanger the players such as a damp pitch or deterioration of the light Off the field in televised matches there is usually a third umpire who can make decisions on certain incidents with the aid of video evidence The third umpire is mandatory under the playing conditions for Test and Limited Overs International matches played between two ICC full member countries These matches also have a match referee whose job is to ensure that play is within the Laws and the spirit of the game The match details including runs and dismissals are recorded by two official scorers one representing each team The scorers are directed by the hand signals of an umpire see image right For example the umpire raises a forefinger to signal that the batter is out has been dismissed he raises both arms above his head if the batter has hit the ball for six runs The scorers are required by the Laws to record all runs scored wickets taken and overs bowled in practice they also note significant amounts of additional data relating to the game A matchs statistics are summarised on a scorecard Prior to the popularisation of scorecards most scoring was done by men sitting on vantage points cuttings notches on tally sticks and runs were originally called notches According to Rowland Bowen the earliest known scorecard templates were introduced in by T Pratt of Sevenoaks and soon came into general use It is believed that scorecards were printed and sold at Lords for the first time in Spirit of the Game Main article Laws of Cricket Besides observing the Laws cricketers must respect the Spirit of Cricket a concept encompassing sportsmanship fair play and mutual respect This spirit has long been considered an integral part of the sport but is only nebulously defined Amidst concern that the spirit was weakening in a Preamble was added to the Laws instructing all participants to play within the spirit of the game The Preamble was last updated in now opening with the line Cricket owes much of its appeal and enjoyment to the fact that it should be played not only according to the Laws but also within the Spirit of Cricket The Preamble is a short statement intended to emphasise the positive behaviours that make cricket an exciting game that encourages leadership friendship and teamwork Its second line states that the major responsibility for ensuring fair play rests with the captains but extends to all players match officials and especially in junior cricket teachers coaches and parents The umpires are the sole judges of fair and unfair play They are required under the Laws to intervene in case of dangerous or unfair play or in cases of unacceptable conduct by a player Previous versions of the Spirit identified actions that were deemed contrary for example appealing knowing that the batter is not out but all specifics are now covered in the Laws of Cricket the relevant governing playing regulations and disciplinary codes or left to the judgement of the umpires captains their clubs and governing bodies The terse expression of the Spirit of Cricket now avoids the diversity of cultural conventions that exist in the detail of sportsmanship or its absence Womens cricket Main article Womens cricket Mithali Raj of India is the highest run scorer in womens international cricket Womens cricket was first recorded in Surrey in International development began at the start of the th century and the first Test match was played between Australia and England in December The following year New Zealand joined them and in Netherland became the tenth womens Test nation when they made their debut

and England in January The men wearing black trousers are the umpires Teams in Test cricket firstclass cricket and club cricket wear traditional white uniforms and use red cricket balls Cricket is a multifaceted sport with multiple formats that can effectively be divided into firstclass cricket limited overs cricket and historically single wicket cricket The highest standard is Test cricket always written with a capital T which is in effect the international version of firstclass cricket and is restricted to teams representing the twelve countries that are full members of the ICC see above Although the term Test match was not coined until much later Test cricket is deemed to have begun with two matches between Australia and England in the Australian season since most Test series between England and Australia have been played for a trophy known as The Ashes The term firstclass in general usage is applied to toplevel domestic cricket Test matches are played over five days and firstclass over three to four days in all of these matches the teams are allotted two innings each and the draw is a valid result Limited overs cricket is always scheduled for completion in a single day and the teams are allotted one innings each There are two main types List A which normally allows fifty overs per team and Twenty in which the teams have twenty overs each Both of the limited overs forms are played internationally as Limited Overs Internationals LOI and Twenty Internationals TI List A was introduced in England in the season as a knockout cup contested by the firstclass county clubs In a national league competition was established The concept was gradually introduced to the other leading cricket countries and the first limited overs international was played in In the first Cricket World Cup took place in England Twenty is a new variant of limited overs itself with the purpose being to complete the match within about three to four hours usually in an evening session The first Twenty World Championship was held in In addition a few fullmember cricket boards have decided to start leagues that are played in the T format in which games are intended to last approximately minutes Limited overs matches cannot be drawn although a tie is possible and an unfinished match is a no result Single wicket was popular in the th and th centuries and its matches were generally considered topclass In this form although each team may have from one to six players there is only one batter in at a time and he must face every delivery bowled while his innings lasts Single wicket has rarely been played since limited overs cricket began Matches tended to have two innings per team like a full firstclass one and they could end in a draw Competitions Cricket is played at both the international and domestic level There is one major international championship per format and toplevel domestic competitions mirror the three main international formats There are now a number of T leagues which have spawned a T freelancer phenomenon International competitions Main article International cricket Most international matches are played as parts of tours when one nation travels to another for a number of weeks or months and plays a number of matches of various sorts against the host nation Sometimes a perpetual trophy is awarded to the winner of the Test

weekends or in the evening Schools cricket first known in southern England in the th century has a similar scenario and both are widely played in the countries where cricket is popular Although there

century in Badminton House Characteristics Contact None Team members Singles or doubles Mixedsex Yes Type Racquet sport Net sport Equipment Shuttlecock racquet Presence Olympic present World Games Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock across a net Although it may be played with larger teams the most common forms of the game are singles with one player per side and doubles with two players per side Badminton is often played as a casual outdoor activity in a yard or on a beach formal games are played on a rectangular indoor court Points are scored by striking the shuttlecock with the racquet and landing it within the other teams half of the court Each side may only strike the shuttlecock once before it passes over the net Play ends once the shuttlecock has struck the floor or ground or if a fault has been called by the umpire service judge or in their absence the opposing side The shuttlecock is a feathered or in informal matches plastic projectile that flies differently from the balls used in many other sports In particular the feathers create much higher drag causing the shuttlecock to decelerate more rapidly Shuttlecocks also have a high top speed compared to the balls in other racquet sports The flight of the shuttlecock gives the sport its distinctive nature The game developed in British India from the earlier game of battledore and shuttlecock European play came to be dominated by Denmark but the game has become very popular in Asia with recent competitions dominated by China In badminton debuted as a Summer Olympic sport with four events mens singles womens singles mens doubles and womens doubles mixed doubles was added four years later At high levels of play the sport demands excellent fitness players require aerobic stamina agility strength speed and precision It is also a technical sport requiring good motor coordination and the development of sophisticated racquet movements History An depiction of battledore and shuttlecock An depiction of battledore and shuttlecock by John Leech Games employing shuttlecocks have been played for centuries across Eurasia a but the modern game of badminton developed in the midth century among the expatriate officers of British India as a variant of the earlier game of battledore and shuttlecock Battledore was an older term for racquet Its exact origin remains obscure The name derives from the Duke of Beaufort s Badminton House in Gloucestershire but why or when remains unclear As early as a London toy dealer named Isaac Spratt published a booklet entitled Badminton Battledore A New Game but no copy is known to have survived An article in The Cornhill Magazine describes badminton as battledore and shuttlecock played with sides across a string suspended some five feet from the ground The game originally developed in India among the British expatriates where it was very popular by the s Ball badminton a form of the game played with a wool ball instead of a shuttlecock was being played in Thanjavur as early as the s and was at first played interchangeably with badminton by the British the woollen ball being preferred in windy or wet weather Early on the game was also known as Poona or Poonah after the garrison town of Poona Pune where it was particularly popular and where the first rules for the game were drawn up in b By officers returning home had started a badminton club in Folkestone Initially the sport was played with sides ranging from to players but it was quickly established that games between two or four competitors worked the best The shuttlecocks were coated with India rubber and in outdoor play sometimes weighted with lead Although the depth of the net was of no consequence it was preferred that it should reach the ground Charles Gleyre Odysseus and Nausicaa with badminton rackets The sport was played under the Pune rules until when J H E Hart of the Bath Badminton Club drew up revised regulations In Hart and Bagnel Wild again revised the rules The Badminton Association of England BAE published these rules in and officially launched the sport at a house called Dunbar c in Portsmouth on September The BAE started the first badminton competition the All England Open Badminton Championships for gentlemens doubles ladies doubles and mixed doubles in Singles competitions were added in and an England Ireland championship match appeared in England Scotland Wales Canada Denmark France Ireland the Netherlands and New Zealand were the founding members of the International Badminton Federation in now known as the Badminton World Federation India joined as an affiliate in The BWF now governs international badminton Although initiated in England competitive mens badminton has traditionally been dominated in Europe by Denmark Worldwide Asian nations have become dominant in international competition China Denmark Indonesia Malaysia India South Korea Taiwan playing as Chinese Taipei and Japan are the nations which have consistently produced worldclass players in the past few decades with China being the greatest force in mens and womens competition recently Great Britain where the rules of the modern game were codified is not among the top powers in the sport but has had significant Olympic and World success in doubles play especially mixed doubles The game has also become a popular backyard sport in the United States Rules The following information is a simplified summary of badminton rules based on the BWF Statutes publication Laws of Badminton Court Badminton court isometric view The court is rectangular and divided into halves by a net Courts are usually marked for both singles and doubles play although badminton rules permit a court to be marked for singles only The doubles court is wider than the singles court but both are of the same length The exception which often causes confusion to newer players is that the doubles court has a shorter servelength dimension The full width of the court is metres feet and in singles this width is reduced to metres feet The full length of the court is metres feet The service courts are marked by a centre line dividing the width of the court by a short service line at a distance of metres feet inches from the net and by the outer side and back boundaries In doubles the service court is also marked by a long service line which is metres feet inches from the back boundary The net is metres feet inch high at the edges and metres feet high in the centre The net posts are placed over the doubles sidelines even when singles is played The minimum height for the ceiling above the court is not mentioned in the Laws of Badminton Nonetheless a badminton court will not be suitable if the ceiling is likely to be hit on a high serve Serving The legal bounds of a badminton court during various stages of a rally for singles and doubles games When the server serves the shuttlecock must pass over the short service line on the opponents court or it will count as a fault The server and receiver must remain within their service courts without touching the boundary lines until the server strikes the shuttlecock The other two players may stand wherever they wish so long as they do not block the vision of the server or receiver At the start of the rally the server and receiver stand in diagonally opposite service courts see court dimensions The server hits the shuttlecock so that it would land in the receivers service court This is similar to tennis except that in a badminton serve the whole shuttle must be below metres from the surface of the court at the instant of being hit by the servers racket the shuttlecock is not allowed to bounce and in badminton the players stand inside their service courts unlike tennis When the serving side loses a rally the server immediately passes to their opponents this differs from the old system where sometimes the serve passes to the doubles partner for what is known as a second serve In singles the server stands in their right service court when their score is even and in their left service court when their score is odd In doubles if the serving side wins a rally the same player continues to serve but heshe changes service courts so that shehe serves to a different opponent each time If the opponents win the rally and their new score is even the player in the right service court serves if odd the player in the left service court serves The players service courts are determined by their positions at the start of the previous rally not by where they were standing at the end of the rally A consequence of this system is that each time a side regains the service the server will be the player who did not serve last time Scoring Main article Scoring system development of badminton Each game is played to points with players scoring a point whenever they win a rally regardless of whether they served this differs from the old system where players could only win a point on their serve and each game was played to points A match is the best of three games If the score ties at then the game continues until one side gains a twopoint lead such as except when there is a tie at in which the game goes to a golden point of Whoever scores this point wins the game At the start of a match the shuttlecock is cast and the side towards which the shuttlecock is pointing serves first Alternatively a coin may be tossed with the winners choosing whether to serve or receive first or choosing which end of the court to occupy first and their opponents making the leftover the remaining choice In subsequent games the winners of the previous game serve first Matches are best out of three a player or pair must win two games of points each to win the match For the first rally of any doubles game the serving pair may decide who serves and the receiving pair may decide who receives The players change ends at the start of the second game if the match reaches a third game they change ends both at the start of the game and when the leading players or pairs score reaches points Lets If a let is called the rally is stopped and replayed with no change to the score Lets may occur because of some unexpected disturbance such as a shuttlecock landing on a court having been hit there by players playing in adjacent court or in small halls the shuttle may touch an overhead rail which can be classed as a let If the receiver is not ready when the service is delivered a let shall be called yet if the receiver attempts to return the shuttlecock the receiver shall be judged to have been ready Equipment Badminton racquets Badminton rules restrict the design and size of racquets and shuttlecocks Racquets Badminton racquets are lightweight with top quality racquets weighing between and grams and ounces not including grip or strings They are composed of many different materials ranging from carbon fibre composite graphite reinforced plastic to solid steel which may be augmented by a variety of materials Carbon fibre has an excellent strength to weight ratio is stiff and gives excellent kinetic energy transfer Before the adoption of carbon fibre composite racquets were made of light metals such as aluminium Earlier still racquets were made of wood Cheap racquets are still often made of metals such as steel but wooden racquets are no longer manufactured for the ordinary market because of their excessive mass and cost Nowadays nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes and fullerene are added to racquets giving them greater durability citation needed There is a wide variety of racquet designs although the laws limit the racquet size and shape Different racquets have playing characteristics that appeal to different players The traditional oval head shape is still available but an isometric head shape is increasingly common in new racquets Strings Badminton strings for racquets are thin highperforming strings with thicknesses ranging from about to mm Thicker strings are more durable but many players prefer the feel of thinner strings String tension is normally in the range of to N to lbf Recreational players generally string at lower tensions than professionals typically between and N and lbf Professionals string between about and N and lbf Some string manufacturers measure the thickness of their strings under tension so they are actually thicker than specified when slack Ashaway Micropower is actually mm but Yonex BG is about mm It is often argued that high string tensions improve control whereas low string tensions increase power The arguments for this generally rely on crude mechanical reasoning such as claiming that a lower tension string bed is more bouncy and therefore provides more power This is in fact incorrect for a higher string tension can cause the shuttle to slide off the racquet and hence make it harder to hit a shot accurately An alternative view suggests that the optimum tension for power depends on the player the faster and more accurately a player can swing their racquet the higher the tension for maximum power Neither view has been subjected to a rigorous mechanical analysis nor is there clear evidence in favour of one or the other The most effective way for a player to find a good string tension is to experiment Badminton Undergrip Flat Grip The choice of grip allows a player to increase the thickness of their racquet handle and choose a comfortable surface to hold A player may build up the handle with one or several grips before applying the final layer Players may choose between a variety of grip materials The most common choices are PU synthetic grips or towelling grips Grip choice is a matter of personal preference Players often find that sweat becomes a problem in this case a drying agent may be applied to the grip or hands sweatbands may be used the player may choose another grip material or change their grip more frequently There are two main types of grip replacement grips and overgrips Replacement grips are thicker and are often used to increase the size of the handle Overgrips are thinner less than mm and are often used as the final layer Many players however prefer to use replacement grips as the final layer Towelling grips are always replacement grips Replacement grips have an adhesive backing whereas overgrips have only a small patch of adhesive at the start of the tape and must be applied under tension overgrips are more convenient for players who change grips frequently because they may be removed more rapidly without damaging the underlying material Shuttlecock A shuttlecock with a plastic skirt Shuttlecocks with feathers Main article Shuttlecock A shuttlecock often abbreviated to shuttle also called a birdie is a highdrag projectile with an open conical shape the cone is formed from sixteen overlapping feathers embedded into a rounded cork base The cork is covered with thin leather or synthetic material Synthetic shuttles are often used by recreational players to reduce their costs as feathered shuttles break easily These nylon shuttles may be constructed with either natural cork or synthetic foam base and a plastic skirt According to Kathmandu Post the feathers used to make shuttlecocks are plucked from living birds which causes pain to the birds Badminton rules also provide for testing a shuttlecock for the correct speed To test a shuttlecock hit a full underhand stroke that makes contact with the shuttlecock over the back boundary line The shuttlecock shall be hit at an upward angle and in a direction parallel to the sidelines A shuttlecock of the correct speed will land not less than mm and not more than mm short of the other back boundary line Shoes Badminton shoes are lightweight with soles of rubber or similar highgrip nonmarking materials Compared to running shoes badminton shoes have little lateral support High levels of lateral support are useful for activities where lateral motion is undesirable and unexpected Badminton however requires powerful lateral movements A highly builtup lateral support will not be able to protect the foot in badminton instead it will encourage catastrophic collapse at the point where the shoes support fails and the players ankles are not ready for the sudden loading which can cause sprains For this reason players should choose badminton shoes rather than general trainers or running shoes because proper badminton shoes will have a very thin sole lower a persons centre of gravity and therefore result in fewer injuries Players should also ensure that they learn safe and proper footwork with the knee and foot in alignment on all lunges This is more than just a safety concern proper footwork is also critical in order to move effectively around the court Technique This section does not cite any sources Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources Unsourced material may

require a high level of skill to perform all of them effectively All strokes can be played either forehand or backhand A players forehand side is the same side as their playing hand for a righthanded player the forehand side is their right side and the backhand side is their left side Forehand strokes are hit with the front of the hand leading like hitting with the palm whereas backhand strokes are hit with the back of the hand leading like hitting with the knuckles Players frequently play certain strokes on the forehand side with a backhand hitting action and vice versa In the forecourt and midcourt most strokes can be played equally effectively on either the forehand or backhand side but in the rear court players will attempt to play as many strokes as possible on their forehands often preferring to play a roundthehead forehand overhead a forehand on the backhand side rather than attempt a backhand overhead Playing a backhand overhead has two main disadvantages First the player must turn their back to their opponents restricting their view of them and the court Second backhand overheads cannot be hit with as much power as forehands the hitting action is limited by the shoulder joint which permits a much greater range of movement for a forehand overhead than for a backhand The backhand clear is considered by most players and coaches to be the most difficult basic stroke in the game since the precise technique is needed in order to muster enough power for the shuttlecock to travel the full length of the court For the same reason backhand smashes tend to be weak Position of the shuttlecock and receiving player Japanese player Sayaka Sato prepares for a forehand serve The choice of stroke depends on how near the shuttlecock is to the net whether it is above net height and where an opponent is currently positioned players have much better attacking options if they can reach the shuttlecock well above net height especially if it is also close to the net In the forecourt a high shuttlecock will be met with a net kill hitting it steeply downwards and attempting to win the rally immediately This is why it is best to drop the shuttlecock just over the net in this situation In the midcourt a high shuttlecock will usually be met with a powerful smash also hitting downwards and hoping for an outright winner or a weak reply Athletic jump smashes where players jump upwards for a steeper smash angle are a common and spectacular element of elite mens doubles play In the rearcourt players strive to hit the shuttlecock while it is still above them rather than allowing it to drop lower This overhead hitting allows them to play smashes clears hitting the shuttlecock high and to the back of the opponents court and drop shots hitting the shuttlecock softly so that it falls sharply downwards into the opponents forecourt If the shuttlecock has dropped lower then a smash is impossible and a fulllength high clear is difficult Vertical position of the shuttlecock When the shuttlecock is well below net height players have no choice but to hit upwards Lifts where the shuttlecock is hit upwards to the back of the opponents court can be played from all parts of the court If a player does not lift their only remaining option is to push the shuttlecock softly back to the net in the forecourt this is called a net shot in the midcourt or rear court it is often called a push or block When the shuttlecock is near to net height players can hit drives which travel flat and rapidly over the net into the opponents rear midcourt and rear court Pushes may also be hit flatter placing the shuttlecock into the front midcourt Drives and pushes may be played from the midcourt or forecourt and are most often used in doubles they are an attempt to regain the attack rather than choosing to lift the shuttlecock and defend against smashes After a successful drive or push the opponents will often be forced to lift the shuttlecock Spin Balls may be spun to alter their bounce for example topspin and backspin in tennis or trajectory and players may slice the ball strike it with an angled racquet face to produce such spin The shuttlecock is not allowed to bounce but slicing the shuttlecock does have applications in badminton See Basic strokes for an explanation of technical terms Slicing the shuttlecock from the side may cause it to travel in a different direction from the direction suggested by the players racquet or body movement This is used to deceive opponents Slicing the shuttlecock from the side may cause it to follow a slightly curved path as seen from above and the deceleration imparted by the spin causes sliced strokes to slow down more suddenly towards the end of their flight path This can be used to create drop shots and smashes that dip more steeply after they pass the net When playing a net shot slicing underneath the shuttlecock may cause it to turn over itself tumble several times as it passes the net This is called a spinning net shot or tumbling net shot The opponent will be unwilling to address the shuttlecock until it has corrected its orientation Due to the way that its feathers overlap a shuttlecock also has a slight natural spin about its axis of rotational symmetry The spin is in a counterclockwise direction as seen from above when dropping a shuttlecock This natural spin affects certain strokes a tumbling net shot is more effective if the slicing action is from right to left rather than from left to right Biomechanics Badminton biomechanics have not been the subject of extensive scientific study but some studies confirm the minor role of the wrist in power generation and indicate that the major contributions to power come from internal and external rotations of the upper and lower arm Recent guides to the sport thus emphasize forearm rotation rather than wrist movements The feathers impart substantial drag causing the shuttlecock to decelerate greatly over distance The shuttlecock is also extremely aerodynamically stable regardless of initial orientation it will turn to fly corkfirst and remain in the corkfirst orientation One consequence of the shuttlecocks drag is that it requires considerable power to hit it the full length of the court which is not the case for most racquet sports The drag also influences the flight path of a lifted lobbed shuttlecock the parabola of its flight is heavily skewed so that it falls at a steeper angle than it rises With very high serves the shuttlecock may even fall vertically Other factors Korean players Lee Yongdae and Ko Sunghyun defend against a smash When defending against a smash players have three basic options lift block or drive In singles a block to the net is the most common reply In doubles a lift is the safest option but it usually allows the opponents to continue smashing blocks and drives are counterattacking strokes but may be intercepted by the smashers partner Many players use a backhand hitting action for returning smashes on both the forehand and backhand sides because backhands are more effective than forehands at covering smashes directed to the body Hard shots directed towards the body are difficult to defend The service is restricted by the Laws and presents its own array of stroke choices Unlike in tennis the servers racquet must be pointing in a downward direction to deliver the serve so normally the shuttle must be hit upwards to pass over the net The server can choose a low serve into the forecourt like a push or a lift to the back of the service court or a flat drive serve Lifted serves may be either high serves where the shuttlecock is lifted so high that it falls almost vertically at the back of the court or flick serves where the shuttlecock is lifted to a lesser height but falls sooner Deception Indonesian player Praveen Jordan showing a loose grip before smashing Once players have mastered these basic strokes they can hit the shuttlecock from and to any part of the court powerfully and softly as required Beyond the basics however badminton offers rich potential for advanced stroke skills that provide a competitive advantage Because badminton players have to cover a short distance as quickly as possible the purpose of many advanced strokes is to deceive the opponent so that either they are tricked into believing that a different stroke is being played or they are forced to delay their movement until they actually sees the shuttles direction Deception in badminton is often used in both of these senses When a player is genuinely deceived they will often lose the point immediately because they cannot change their direction quickly enough to reach the shuttlecock Experienced players will be aware of the trick and cautious not to move too early but the attempted deception is still useful because it forces the opponent to delay their movement slightly Against weaker players whose intended strokes are obvious an experienced player may move before the shuttlecock has been hit anticipating the stroke to gain an advantage Slicing and using a shortened hitting action are the two main technical devices that facilitate deception Slicing involves hitting the shuttlecock with an angled racquet face causing it to travel in a different direction than suggested by the body or arm movement Slicing also causes the shuttlecock to travel more slowly than the arm movement suggests For example a good crosscourt sliced drop shot will use a hitting action that suggests a straight clear or a smash deceiving the opponent about both the power and direction of the shuttlecock A more sophisticated slicing action involves brushing the strings around the shuttlecock during the hit in order to make the shuttlecock spin This can be used to improve the shuttles trajectory by making it dip more rapidly as it passes the net for example a sliced low serve can travel slightly faster than a normal low serve yet land on the same spot Spinning the shuttlecock is also used to create spinning net shots also called tumbling net shots in which the shuttlecock turns over itself several times tumbles before stabilizing sometimes the shuttlecock remains inverted instead of tumbling The main advantage of a spinning net shot is that the opponent will be unwilling to address the shuttlecock until it has stopped tumbling since hitting the feathers will result in an unpredictable stroke Spinning net shots are especially important for highlevel singles players The lightness of modern racquets allows players to use a very short hitting action for many strokes thereby maintaining the option to hit a powerful or a soft stroke until the last possible moment For example a singles player may hold their racquet ready for a net shot but then flick the shuttlecock to the back instead with a shallow lift when they notice the opponent has moved before the actual shot was played A shallow lift takes less time to reach the ground and as mentioned above a rally is over when the shuttlecock touches the ground This makes the opponents task of covering the whole court much more difficult than if the lift was hit higher and with a bigger obvious swing A short hitting action is not only useful for deception it also allows the player to hit powerful strokes when they have no time for a big arm swing A big arm swing is also usually not advised in badminton because bigger swings make it more difficult to recover for the next shot in fast exchanges The use of grip tightening is crucial to these techniques and is often described as finger power Elite players develop finger power to the extent that they can hit some power strokes such as net kills with less than a centimetres inches racquet swing It is also possible to reverse this style of deception by suggesting a powerful stroke before slowing down the hitting action to play a soft stroke In general this latter style of deception is more common in the rear court for example drop shots disguised as smashes whereas the former style is more common in the forecourt and midcourt for example lifts disguised as net shots Deception is not limited to slicing and short hitting actions Players may also use double motion where they make an initial racquet movement in one direction before withdrawing the racquet to hit in another direction Players will often do this to send opponents in the wrong direction The racquet movement is typically used to suggest a straight angle but then play the stroke crosscourt or vice versa Triple motion is also possible but this is very rare in actual play An alternative to double motion is to use a racquet head fake where the initial motion is continued but the racquet is turned during the hit This produces a smaller change in direction but does not require as much time Strategy This section does not cite any sources Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources Unsourced material may be challenged and removed September Learn how and when to remove this template message To win in badminton players need to employ a wide variety of strokes in the right situations These range from powerful jumping smashes to delicate tumbling net returns Often rallies finish with a smash but setting up the smash requires subtler strokes For example a net shot can force the opponent to lift the shuttlecock which gives an opportunity to smash If the net shot is tight and tumbling then the opponents lift will not reach the back of the court which makes the subsequent smash much harder to return Deception is also important Expert players prepare for many different strokes that look identical and use slicing to deceive their opponents about the speed or direction of the stroke If an opponent tries to anticipate the stroke they may move in the wrong direction and may be unable to change their body momentum in time to reach the shuttlecock Singles Since one person needs to cover the entire court singles tactics are based on forcing the opponent to move as much as possible this means that singles strokes are normally directed to the corners of the court Players exploit the length of the court by combining lifts and clears with drop shots and net shots Smashing tends to be less prominent in singles than in doubles because the smasher has no partner to follow up their effort and is thus vulnerable to a skillfully placed return Moreover frequent smashing can be exhausting in singles where the conservation of a players energy is at a premium However players with strong smashes will sometimes use the shot to create openings and players commonly smash weak returns to try to end rallies In singles players will often start the rally with a forehand high serve or with a flick serve Low serves are also used frequently either forehand or backhand Drive serves are rare At high levels of play singles demand extraordinary fitness Singles is a game of patient positional manoeuvring unlike the allout aggression of doubles Doubles Indian women players Ashwini Ponnappa and Jwala Gutta at BWF World Championships Both pairs will try to gain and maintain the attack smashing downwards when the opportunity arises Whenever possible a pair will adopt an ideal attacking formation with one player hitting down from the rear court and their partner in the midcourt intercepting all smash returns except the lift If the rear court attacker plays a drop shot their partner will move into the forecourt to threaten the net reply If a pair cannot hit downwards they will use flat strokes in an attempt to gain the attack If a pair is forced to lift or clear the shuttlecock then they must defend they will adopt a sidebyside position in the rear midcourt to cover the full width of their court against the opponents smashes In doubles players generally smash to the middle ground between two players in order to take advantage of confusion and clashes At high levels of play the backhand serve has become popular to the extent that forehand serves have become fairly rare at a high level of play The straight low serve is used most frequently in an attempt to prevent the opponents gaining the attack immediately Flick serves are used to prevent the opponent from anticipating the low serve and attacking it decisively At high levels of play doubles rallies are extremely fast Mens doubles are the most aggressive form of badminton with a high proportion of powerful jump smashes and very quick reflex exchanges Because of this spectator interest is sometimes greater for mens doubles than for singles Mixed doubles The Olympic mixed doubles final in London In mixed doubles both pairs typically try to maintain an attacking formation with the woman at the front and the man at the back This is because the male players are usually substantially stronger and can therefore produce smashes that are more powerful As a result mixed doubles require greater tactical awareness and subtler positional play Clever opponents will try to reverse the ideal position by forcing the woman towards the back or the man towards the front In order to protect against this danger mixed players must be careful and systematic in their shot selection At high levels of play the formations will generally be more flexible the top women players are capable of playing powerfully from the backcourt and will happily do so if required When the opportunity arises however the pair will switch back to the standard mixed attacking position with the woman in front and men in the back Organization Governing bodies The Badminton World Federation BWF is the internationally recognized governing body of the sport responsible for the regulation of tournaments and

The BWF organizes several international competitions including the Thomas Cup the premier mens international team event first held in and the Uber Cup the womens equivalent first held in The competitions now take place once every two years More than national teams compete in qualifying tournaments within continental confederations for a place in the finals The final tournament involves teams following an increase from eight teams in It was further increased to teams in The Sudirman Cup a gendermixed international team event held once every two years began in Teams are divided into seven levels based on the performance of each country To win the tournament a country must perform well across all five disciplines mens doubles and singles womens doubles and singles and mixed doubles Like association football soccer it features a promotion and relegation system at every level However the system was last used in and teams competing will now be grouped by world rankings Badminton was a demonstration event at the and Summer Olympics It became an official Summer Olympic sport at the Barcelona Olympics in and its gold medals now generally rate as the sports most coveted prizes for individual players In the BWF World Championships first held in currently only the highestranked players in the world and a maximum of four from each country can participate in any category Therefore its not an open format In both the BWF World and the Olympic competitions restrictions on the number of participants from any one country have caused some controversy because they result in excluding some world elite level players from the strongest badminton nations The Thomas Uber and Sudirman Cups the Olympics and the BWF World and World Junior Championships are all categorized as level one tournaments At the start of the BWF introduced a new tournament structure for the highest level tournaments aside from those in level one the BWF Super Series This level two tournament series is a circuit for the worlds elite players staging twelve open tournaments around the world with players half the previous limit The players collect points that determine whether they can play in Super Series Finals held at the yearend Among the tournaments in this series is the venerable AllEngland Championships first held in which was once considered the unofficial world championships of the sport Level three tournaments consist of Grand Prix Gold and Grand Prix event Top players can collect the world ranking points and enable them to play in the BWF Super Series open tournaments These include the regional competitions in Asia Badminton Asia Championships and Europe European Badminton Championships which produce the worlds best players as well as the Pan America Badminton

this template message Badminton is frequently compared to tennis due to several qualities The following is a list of manifest differences Scoring In badminton a match is played best of of games with each game played up to points In tennis a match is played best of or sets each set consisting of games and each game ends when one player wins points or wins two consecutive points at deuce points If both teams are tied at game point they must play until one team achieves a twopoint advantage However at all whoever scores the golden point will win In tennis if the score is tied in a set a tiebreaker will be played which ends once a player reaches points or when one player has a twopoint advantage In tennis the ball may bounce once before the point ends in badminton the rally ends once the shuttlecock touches the floor In tennis the serve is dominant to the extent that the server is expected to win most of their service games at advanced level onwards a break of service where the server loses the game is of major importance in a match In badminton a server has far less an advantage and is unlikely to score an ace unreturnable serve In tennis the server has two chances to hit a serve into the service box in badminton the server is allowed only one attempt A tennis court is approximately twice the length and width of a badminton court Tennis racquets are about four times as heavy as badminton racquets to ounces to grams versus to ounces to grams Tennis balls are more than eleven times heavier than shuttlecocks grams ounces versus grams ounces The fastest recorded tennis stroke is Samuel Groth s miles per hour kilometres per hour serve whereas the fastest badminton stroke during gameplay was Mads Pieler Kolding s miles per hour kilometres per hour recorded smash at a Badminton Premier League match Statistics such as the smash speed above prompt badminton enthusiasts to make other comparisons that are more contentious For example it is often claimed that badminton is the fastest racquet sport Although badminton holds the record for the fastest initial speed of a racquet sports projectile the shuttlecock decelerates substantially faster than other projectiles such as tennis balls In turn this qualification must be qualified by consideration of the distance over which the shuttlecock travels a smashed shuttlecock travels a shorter distance than a tennis ball during a serve While fans of badminton and tennis often claim that their sport is the more physically demanding such comparisons are difficult to make objectively because of the differing demands of the games No formal study currently exists evaluating the physical condition of the players or demands during gameplay Badminton and tennis techniques differ substantially The lightness of the shuttlecock and of badminton racquets allows badminton players to make use of the wrist and fingers much more than tennis players in tennis the wrist is normally held stable and playing with a mobile wrist may lead to injury For the same reasons badminton players can generate power from a short racquet swing for some strokes such as net kills an elite players swing may be less than centimetres inches For strokes that require more power a longer swing will typically be used but the badminton racquet swing will rarely be as long as a typical tennis swing See also Ball badminton Hanetsuki List

Invented in by CanadianAmerican gym teacher James Naismith in Springfield Massachusetts in the United States basketball has evolved to become one of the worlds most popular and widely viewed sports The National Basketball Association NBA is the most significant professional basketball league in the world in terms of popularity salaries talent and level of competition drawing most of its talent from US college basketball Outside North America the top clubs from national leagues qualify to continental championships such as the EuroLeague and the Basketball Champions League Americas The FIBA Basketball World Cup and Mens Olympic Basketball Tournament are the major international events of the sport and attract top national teams from around the world Each continent hosts regional competitions for national teams like EuroBasket and FIBA AmeriCup The FIBA Womens Basketball World Cup and Womens Olympic Basketball Tournament feature top national teams from continental championships The main North American league is the WNBA NCAA Womens Division I Basketball Championship is also popular whereas the strongest European clubs participate in the EuroLeague Women History Main article History of basketball Creation James Naismith c In December James Naismith a CanadianAmerican professor of physical education and instructor at the International Young Mens Christian Association Training School now Springfield College in Springfield Massachusetts was trying to keep his gym class active on a rainy day He sought a vigorous indoor game to keep his students occupied and at proper levels of fitness during the long New England winters After rejecting other ideas as either too rough or poorly suited to walledin gymnasiums he invented a new game in which players would pass a ball to teammates and try to score points by tossing the ball into a basket mounted on a wall Naismith wrote the basic rules and nailed a peach basket onto an elevated track Naismith initially set up the peach basket with its bottom intact which meant that the ball had to be retrieved manually after each basket or point scored This quickly proved tedious so Naismith removed the bottom of the basket to allow the balls to be poked out with a long dowel after each scored basket The first basketball court Springfield College Oldstyle basketball with laces Basketball was originally played with a soccer ball These round balls from association football were made at the time with a set of laces to close off the hole needed for inserting the inflatable bladder after the other sewntogether segments of the balls cover had been flipped outsidein These laces could cause bounce passes and dribbling to be unpredictable Eventually a lacefree ball construction method was invented and this change to the game was endorsed by Naismith whereas in American football the lace construction proved to be advantageous for gripping and remains to this day The first balls made specifically for basketball were brown and it was only in the late s that Tony Hinkle searching for a ball that would be more visible to players and spectators alike introduced the orange ball that is now in common use Dribbling was not part of the original game except for the bounce pass to teammates Passing the ball was the primary means of ball movement Dribbling was eventually introduced but limited by the asymmetric shape of early balls dubious discuss Dribbling was common by with a rule against the double dribble by The peach baskets were used until when they were finally replaced by metal hoops with backboards A further change was soon made so the ball merely passed through Whenever a person got the ball in the basket his team would gain a point Whichever team got the most points won the game The baskets were originally nailed to the mezzanine balcony of the playing court but this proved impractical when spectators in the balcony began to interfere with shots The backboard was introduced to prevent this interference it had the additional effect of allowing rebound shots Naismiths handwritten diaries discovered by his granddaughter in early indicate that he was nervous about the new game he had invented which incorporated rules from a childrens game called duck on a rock as many had failed before it Frank Mahan one of the players from the original first game approached Naismith after the Christmas break in early asking him what he intended to call his new game Naismith replied that he had not thought of it because he had been focused on just getting the game started Mahan suggested that it be called Naismith ball at which he laughed saying that a name like that would kill any game Mahan then said Why not call it basketball Naismith replied We have a basket and a ball and it seems to me that would be a good name for it The first official game was played in the YMCA gymnasium in Albany New York on January with nine players The game ended at the shot was made from feet m on a court just half the size of a presentday Streetball or National Basketball Association NBA court At the time soccer was being played with to a team which was increased to When winter weather got too icy to play soccer teams were taken indoors and it was convenient to have them split in half and play basketball with five on each side By teams of five became standard College basketball Main article College basketball The University of Kansas basketball team with James Naismith at the back right Basketballs early adherents were dispatched to YMCAs throughout the United States and it quickly spread through the United States and Canada By it was well established at several womens high schools While YMCA was responsible for initially developing and spreading the game within a decade it discouraged the new sport as rough play and rowdy crowds began to detract from YMCAs primary mission However other amateur sports clubs colleges and professional clubs quickly filled the void In the years before World War I the Amateur Athletic Union and the Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the United States forerunner of the NCAA vied for control over the rules for the game The first pro league the National Basketball League was formed in to protect players from exploitation and to promote a less rough game This league only lasted five years James Naismith was instrumental in establishing college basketball His colleague C O Beamis fielded the first college basketball team just a year after the Springfield YMCA game at the suburban Pittsburgh Geneva College Naismith himself later coached at the University of Kansas for six years before handing the reins to renowned coach Forrest Phog Allen Naismiths disciple Amos Alonzo Stagg brought basketball to the University of Chicago while Adolph Rupp a student of Naismiths at Kansas enjoyed great success as coach at the University of Kentucky On February the first intercollegiate on game was played at

length except for high school which is four minutes in length Teams exchange baskets for the second half The time allowed is actual playing time the clock is stopped while the play is not active

meters and one basket is at each end of the court The white outlined box on the backboard is inches cm high and feet cm wide At almost all levels of competition the top of the rim is exactly feet meters above the court and feet meters inside the baseline While variation is possible in the dimensions of the court and backboard it is considered important for the basket to be of the correct height a rim that is off by just a few inches can have an adverse effect on shooting The net must check the ball momentarily as it passes through the basket to aid the visual confirmation that the ball went through The act of checking the ball has the further advantage of slowing down the ball so the rebound does not go as far The size of the basketball is also regulated For men the official ball is inches cm in circumference size or a ball and weighs oz g If women are playing the official basketball size is inches cm in circumference size or a ball with a weight of oz g In x a formalized

on whether the shot was successful One point is awarded for making a free throw which is attempted from a line feet m from the basket The referee is responsible for judging whether contact is illegal sometimes resulting in controversy The calling of fouls can vary between games leagues and referees There is a second category of fouls called technical fouls which may be charged for various rules violations including failure to properly record a player in the scorebook or for unsportsmanlike conduct These infractions result in one or two free throws which may be taken by any of the five players on the court at the time Repeated incidents can result in disqualification A blatant foul involving physical contact that is either excessive or unnecessary is called an intentional foul flagrant foul in the NBA In FIBA and NCAA womens basketball a foul resulting in ejection is called a disqualifying foul while in leagues other than the NBA such a foul is referred to as flagrant If a team exceeds a certain limit of team fouls in a given period quarter or half four for NBA NCAA womens and international games the opposing team is awarded one or two free throws on all subsequent nonshooting fouls for that period the number depending on the league In the US college mens game and high school games for both sexes if a team reaches fouls in a half the opposing team is awarded one free throw along with a second shot if the first is made This is called shooting oneandone If a team exceeds fouls in the half the opposing team is awarded two free throws on all subsequent fouls for the half When a team shoots foul shots the opponents may not interfere with the shooter nor may they try to regain possession until the last or potentially last free throw is in the air After a team has committed a specified number of fouls the other team is said to be in the bonus On scoreboards this is usually signified with an indicator light reading Bonus or Penalty with an illuminated directional arrow or dot indicating that team is to receive free throws when fouled by the opposing team Some scoreboards also indicate the number of fouls committed If a team misses the first shot of a twoshot situation the opposing team must wait for the completion of the second shot before attempting to reclaim possession of the ball and continuing play If a player is fouled while attempting a shot and the shot is unsuccessful the player is awarded a number of free throws equal to the value of the attempted shot A player fouled while attempting a regular twopoint shot thus receives two shots and a player fouled while attempting a threepoint shot receives three shots If a player is fouled while attempting a shot and the shot is successful typically the player will be awarded one additional free throw for one point In combination with a regular shot this is called a threepoint play or fourpoint play or more colloquially an and one because of the basket made at the time of the foul or points and the additional free throw point A foul committed during a shot attempt Common techniques and practices Positions Main article Basketball positions Basketball positions in the offensive zone Although the rules do not specify any positions whatsoever they have evolved as part of basketball During the early years of basketballs evolution two guards two forwards and one center were used In more recent times specific positions evolved but the current trend advocated by many top coaches including Mike Krzyzewski is towards positionless basketball where big players are free to shoot from outside and dribble if their skill allows it Popular descriptions of positions include Point guard often called the usually the fastest player on the team organizes the teams offense by controlling the ball and making sure that it gets to the right player at the right time Shooting guard the creates a high volume of shots on offense mainly longranged and guards the opponents best perimeter player on defense Small forward the often primarily responsible for scoring points via cuts to the basket and dribble penetration on defense seeks rebounds and steals but sometimes plays more actively Power forward the plays offensively often with their back to the basket on defense plays under the basket in a zone defense or against the opposing power forward in mantoman defense Center the uses height and size to score on offense to protect the basket closely on defense or to rebound The above descriptions are flexible For most teams today the shooting guard and small forward have very similar responsibilities and are often called the wings as do the power forward and center who are often called post players While most teams describe two players as guards two as forwards and one as a center on some occasions teams choose to call them by different designations Strategy Main article Basketball playbook There are two main defensive strategies zone defense and mantoman defense In a zone defense each player is assigned to guard a specific area of the court Zone defenses often allow the defense to double team the ball a manoeuver known as a trap In a mantoman defense each defensive player guards a specific opponent Offensive plays are more varied normally involving planned passes and movement by players without the ball A quick movement by an offensive player without the ball to gain an advantageous position is known as a cut A legal attempt by an offensive player to stop an opponent from guarding a teammate by standing in the defenders way such that the teammate cuts next to him is a screen or pick The two plays are combined in the pick and roll in which a player sets a pick and then rolls away from the pick towards the basket Screens and cuts are very important in offensive plays these allow the quick passes and teamwork which can lead to a successful basket Teams almost always have several offensive plays planned to ensure their movement is not predictable On court the point guard is usually responsible for indicating which play will occur Shooting Player releases a short jump shot while her defender is either knocked down or trying to take a charge Shooting is the act of attempting to score points by throwing the ball through the basket methods varying with players and situations Typically a player faces the basket with both feet facing the basket A player will rest the ball on the fingertips of the dominant hand the shooting arm slightly above the head with the other hand supporting the side of the ball The ball is usually shot by jumping though not always and extending the shooting arm The shooting arm fully extended with the wrist fully bent is held stationary for a moment following the release of the ball known as a followthrough Players often try to put a steady backspin on the ball to absorb its impact with the rim The ideal trajectory of the shot is somewhat controversial but generally a proper arc is recommended Players may shoot directly into the basket or may use the backboard to redirect the ball into the basket Basketball falling through hoop The two most common shots that use the above described setup are the set shot and the jump shot Both are preceded by a crouching action which preloads the muscles and increases the power of the shot In a set shot the shooter straightens up and throws from a standing position with neither foot leaving the floor this is typically used for free throws For a jump shot the throw is taken in midair with the ball being released near the top of the jump This provides much greater power and range and it also allows the player to elevate over the defender Failure to release the ball before the feet return to the floor is considered a traveling violation Another common shot is called the layup This shot requires the player to be in motion toward the basket and to lay the ball up and into the basket typically off the backboard the backboardfree underhand version is called a finger roll The most crowdpleasing and typically highestpercentage accuracy shot is the slam dunk in which the player jumps very high and throws the ball downward through the basket while touching it Slowmotion animation of a dunk Another shot that is less common than the layup is the circus shot The circus shot is a lowpercentage shot that is flipped heaved scooped or flung toward the hoop while the shooter is offbalance airborne falling down or facing away from the basket A backshot is a shot taken when the player is facing away from the basket and may be shot with the dominant hand or both but there is a very low chance that the shot will be successful A shot that misses both the rim and the backboard completely is referred to as an air ball A particularly bad shot or one that only hits the backboard is jocularly called a brick The hang time is the length of time a player stays in the air after jumping either to make a slam dunk layup or jump shot Rebounding Main article Rebound basketball A player making an offensive rebound The objective of rebounding is to successfully gain possession of the basketball after a missed field goal or free throw as it rebounds from the hoop or backboard This plays a major role in the game as most possessions end when a team misses a shot There are two categories of rebounds offensive rebounds in which the ball is recovered by the offensive side and does not change possession and defensive rebounds in which the defending team gains possession of the loose ball The majority of rebounds are defensive as the team on defense tends to be in better position to recover missed shots for example about of rebounds in the NBA are defensive Passing See also Assist basketball A pass is a method of moving the ball between players Most passes are accompanied by a step forward to increase power and are followed through with the hands to ensure accuracy A staple pass is the chest pass The ball is passed directly from the passers chest to the receivers chest A proper chest pass involves an outward snap of the thumbs to add velocity and leaves the defence little time to react Another type of pass is the bounce pass Here the passer bounces the ball crisply about twothirds of the way from his own chest to the receiver The ball strikes the court and bounces up toward the receiver The bounce pass takes longer to complete than the chest pass but it is also harder for the opposing team to intercept kicking the ball deliberately is a violation Thus players often use the bounce pass in crowded moments or to pass around a defender The overhead pass is used to pass the ball over a defender The ball is released while over the passers head The outlet pass occurs after a team gets a defensive rebound The next pass after the rebound is the outlet pass The crucial aspect of any good pass is it being difficult to intercept Good passers can pass the ball with great accuracy and they know exactly where each of their other teammates prefers to receive the ball A special way of doing this is passing the ball without looking at the receiving teammate This is called a nolook pass Another advanced style of passing is the behindtheback pass which as the description implies involves throwing the ball behind the passers back to a teammate Although some players can perform such a pass effectively many coaches discourage nolook or behindtheback passes believing them to be difficult to control and more likely to result in turnovers or violations Dribbling A demonstration of the basic types of dribbling in basketball A US Naval Academy Navy player left posts up a US Military Academy Army defender Main article Dribble Dribbling is the act of bouncing the ball continuously with one hand and is a requirement for a player to take steps with the ball To dribble a player pushes the ball down towards the ground with the fingertips rather than patting it this ensures greater control When dribbling past an opponent the dribbler should dribble with the hand farthest from the opponent making it more difficult for the defensive player to get to the ball It is therefore important for a player to be able to dribble competently with both hands Good dribblers or ball handlers tend to keep their dribbling hand low to the ground reducing the distance of travel of the ball from the floor to the hand making it more difficult for the defender to steal the ball Good ball handlers frequently dribble behind their backs between their legs and switch directions suddenly making a less predictable dribbling pattern that is more difficult to defend against This is called a crossover which is the most effective way to move past defenders while dribbling A skilled player can dribble without watching the ball using the dribbling motion or peripheral vision to keep track of the balls location By not having to focus on the ball a player can look for teammates or scoring opportunities as well as avoid the danger of having someone steal the ball away from himher Blocking Main article Block basketball A block is performed when after a shot is attempted a defender succeeds in altering the shot by touching the ball In almost all variants of play it is illegal to touch the ball after it is in the downward path of its arc this is known as goaltending It is also illegal under NBA and Mens NCAA basketball to block a shot after it has touched the backboard or when any part of the ball is directly above the rim Under international rules it is illegal to block a shot that is in the downward path of its arc or one that has touched the backboard until the ball has hit the rim After the ball hits the rim it is again legal to touch it even though it is no longer considered as a block performed To block a shot a player has to be able to reach a point higher than where the shot is released Thus height can be an advantage in blocking Players who are taller and playing the power forward or center positions generally record more blocks than players who are shorter and playing the guard positions However with good timing and a sufficiently high vertical leap even shorter players can be effective shot blockers Height Joonas Suotamo a FinnishAmerican former professional center is feet inches m tall Many professional centers heights exceed feet m At the professional level most male players are above feet inches m and most women above feet inches m Guards for whom physical coordination and ballhandling skills are crucial tend to be the smallest players Almost all forwards in the top mens pro leagues are feet inches m or taller Most centers are over feet inches m tall According to a survey given to all NBA teams when the average height of all NBA players is just under feet inches m with the average weight being close to pounds kg The tallest players ever in the NBA were Manute Bol and Gheorghe Murean who were both feet inches m tall At feet inches m Margo Dydek was the tallest player in the history of the WNBA The shortest player ever to play in the NBA is Muggsy Bogues at feet inches m Other averageheight or relatively short players have thrived at the pro level including Anthony Spud Webb who was feet inches m tall but had a inch m vertical leap giving him significant height when jumping and Temeka Johnson who won the WNBA Rookie of the Year Award and a championship with the Phoenix Mercury while standing only feet inches m While shorter players are often at a disadvantage in certain aspects of the game their ability to navigate quickly through crowded areas of the court and steal the ball by reaching low are strengths Players regularly inflate their height in high school or college Many prospects exaggerate their height while in high school or college to make themselves more appealing to coaches and scouts who prefer taller players Charles Barkley stated Ive been measured at But I started in college at Sam Smith a former writer from the Chicago Tribune said We sort of know the heights because after camp the sheet comes out But you use that height and the player gets mad And then you hear from his agent Or you file your story with the right height and the copy desk changes it because they have the official NBA media guide which is wrong So you sort of go along with the joke Since the NBA season heights of NBA players are recorded definitively by measuring players with their shoes off Variations and similar games Main article Variations of basketball Variations of basketball are activities based on the game of basketball using common basketball skills and equipment primarily the ball and basket Some variations only have superficial rule changes while others are distinct games with varying degrees of influence from basketball Other variations include childrens games contests or activities meant to help players reinforce skills An earlier version of basketball played

single most common variation of basketball is the halfcourt game played in informal settings without referees or strict rules Only one basket is used and the ball must be taken back or cleared passed or dribbled outside the threepoint line each time possession of the ball changes from one team to the other Halfcourt games require less cardiovascular stamina since players need not run back and forth a full court Halfcourt raises the number of players that can use a court or conversely can be played if there is an insufficient number to form full on teams Halfcourt basketball is usually played on on or on The latter variation is gradually gaining official recognition as x originally known as FIBA It was first tested at the Asian Indoor Games in Macau and the first official tournaments were held at the Asian Youth Games and the Youth Olympics both in Singapore The first FIBA x Youth World Championships were held in Rimini Italy in with the first FIBA x World

Water basketball Beach basketball Streetball Oneonone is a variation in which two players will use only a small section of the court often no more than a half of a court and compete to play the ball into a single hoop Such games tend to emphasize individual dribbling and ball stealing skills over shooting and team play Dunk Hoops is a variation played on basketball hoops with lowered under basketball regulation feet rims It originated when the popularity of the slam dunk grew and was developed to create better chances for dunks with lowered rims and using altered goaltending rules Unicycle basketball is played using a regulation basketball on a regular basketball court with the same rules for example one must dribble the ball while riding There are a number of rules that are particular to unicycle basketball as well for example a player must have at least one foot on a pedal when inbounding the ball Unicycle basketball is usually played using or smaller unicycles and using plastic pedals both to preserve the court and the players shins Popular unicycle basketball games are organized in North America Spinoffs from basketball that are now separate sports include

other uses see Hockey disambiguation Turf and water sports Field hockey Underwater hockey Roller sports inline and quad Inline hockey Inline skater hockey Roller hockey quad Winter sports Ice hockey Para ice hockey Bandy Hockey is a term used to denote a family of various types of both summer and winter team sports which originated on either an outdoor field sheet of ice or dry floor such as in a gymnasium While these sports vary in specific rules numbers of players apparel and playing surface they share broad characteristics of two opposing teams using a stick to propel a ball or disk into a goal There are many types of hockey Some games make the use of skates either wheeled or bladed while others do not In order to help make the distinction between these various games the word hockey is often preceded by another word ie field hockey ice hockey roller hockey rink hockey or floor hockey In each of these sports two teams play against each other by trying to manoeuvre the object of play either a type of ball or a disk such as a puck into the opponents goal using a hockey stick Two notable exceptions use a straight stick and an open disk still referred to as a puck with a hole in the center instead The first case is a style of floor hockey whose rules were codified in during the Great Depression by Canadas Sam Jacks The second case involves a variant which was later modified in roughly the s to make a related game that would be considered suitable for inclusion as a team sport in the newly emerging Special Olympics The floor game of gym ringette though related to floor hockey is not a true variant due to the fact that it was designed in the s and modelled off of the Canadian ice skating team sport of ringette which was invented in Canada in Ringette was also invented by Sam Jacks the same Canadian who codified the rules for the open disk style of floor hockey Certain sports which share general characteristics with the forms of hockey but are not generally referred to as hockey include lacrosse hurling camogie and shinty Etymology The first recorded use of the word hockey is in the book Juvenile Sports and Pastimes to Which Are Prefixed Memoirs of the Author Including a New Mode of Infant Education by Richard Johnson Pseud Master Michel Angelo whose chapter XI was titled New Improvements on the Game of Hockey The belief that hockey was mentioned in a proclamation by King Edward III of England is based on modern translations of the proclamation which was originally in Latin and explicitly forbade the games Pilam Manualem Pedivam Bacularem ad Canibucam Gallorum Pugnam The English historian and biographer John Strype did not use the word hockey when he translated the proclamation in instead translating Canibucam as Cambuck this may have referred to either an early form of hockey or a game more similar to golf or croquet The word hockey itself is of unknown origin One supposition is that it is a derivative of hoquet a Middle French word for a shepherds stave The curved or hooked ends of the sticks used for hockey would indeed have resembled these staves and similar folk etymologies exist for the batandball sports of Croquet and Cricket Another supposition derives from the known use of cork bungs stoppers in place of wooden balls to play the game The stoppers came from barrels containing hock ale also called hocky Modern usage The word hockey in Canada the United States Russia and most of Eastern and Northern Europe typically refers to ice hockey Sledge hockey or sled hockey is now called Para ice hockey It is the only hockey sport on ice created exclusively for participants with physical disabilities In most of the world the term hockey when used without clarification refers to field hockey while in Canada the United States Russia and most of Eastern and Northern Europe the term usually refers to ice hockey In more recent history the word hockey is used in reference to either the summer Olympic sport of field hockey which is a stick and ball game and the winter ice team skating sports of bandy and ice hockey This is due to the fact that field hockey and other stick and ball sports and their related variants preceded games which would eventually be played on ice with ice skates namely bandy and ice hockey as well as sports involving dry floors such as roller hockey and floor hockey However the hockey referred to in common parlance often depends on locale geography and the size and popularity of the sport involved For example in Europe hockey more typically refers to field hockey whereas in Canada it typically refers to ice hockey In the case of bandy the game was initially called hockey on the ice and preceded the organization and development of ice hockey but was officially changed to bandy in the early th century in order to avoid confusion with ice hockey a separate sport Bandy while related to other hockey games derives some of its inspiration from Association football Sledge
