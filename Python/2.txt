Association football soccer Australian rules football Gaelic football GAA Rugby league football Rugby union football Several codes of football Football is a family of team sports that involve to varying degrees kicking a ball to score a goal Unqualified the word football normally means the form of football that is the most popular where the word is used Sports commonly called football include association football known as soccer in Australia Canada South Africa the United States and sometimes in Ireland and New Zealand Australian rules football Gaelic football gridiron football specifically American football Arena football or Canadian football International rules football rugby league football and rugby union football These various forms of football share to varying degrees common origins and are known as football codes There are a number of references to traditional ancient or prehistoric ball games played in many different parts of the world Contemporary codes of football can be traced back to the codification of these games at English public schools during the th century itself an outgrowth of medieval football The expansion and cultural power of the British Empire allowed these rules of football to spread to areas of British influence outside the directly controlled Empire By the end of the th century distinct regional codes were already developing Gaelic football for example deliberately incorporated the rules of local traditional football games in order to maintain their heritage In the Football League was founded in England becoming the first of many professional football associations During the th century several of the various kinds of football grew to become some of the most popular team sports in the world Common elements The action of kicking in clockwise from upper left association gridiron rugby and Australian football The various codes of football share certain common elements and can be grouped into two main classes of football carrying codes like American football Canadian football Australian football rugby union and rugby league where the ball is moved about the field while being held in the hands or thrown and kicking codes such as association football and Gaelic football where the ball is moved primarily with the feet and where handling is strictly limited Common rules among the sports include Two teams usually have between and players some variations that have fewer players five or more per team are also popular A clearly defined area in which to play the game Scoring goals or points by moving the ball to an opposing teams end of the field and either into a goal area or over a line Goals or points resulting from players putting the ball between two goalposts The goal or line being defended by the opposing team Players using only their body to move the ball ie no additional equipment such as bats or sticks In all codes common skills include passing tackling evasion of tackles catching and kicking In most codes there are rules restricting the movement of players offside and players scoring a goal must put the ball either under or over a crossbar between the goalposts Etymology Main article Football word There are conflicting explanations of the origin of the word football It is widely assumed that the word football or the phrase foot ball refers to the action of the foot kicking a ball There is an alternative explanation which is that football originally referred to a variety of games in medieval Europe that were played on foot There is no conclusive evidence for either explanation Early history Ancient games See also Episkyros and Cuju Ancient China A painting depicting Emperor Taizu of Song playing cuju ie Chinese football with his prime minister Zhao Pu and other ministers by the Yuan dynasty artist Qian Xuan The Chinese competitive game cuju It existed during the Han dynasty and possibly the Qin dynasty in the second and third centuries BC attested by descriptions in a military manual The game consisted on passsing the ball to each other without touching the floor in its competitive version two teams had to pass the ball without touching to finally kick the ball throught a circular hole placed in the middle of the pitch but unlike association football the two teams didnt interact with each other and stayed in different sides of the pitch like volleyball The Japanese version of cuju is kemari and was developed during the Asuka period This is known to have been played within the Japanese imperial court in Kyoto from about AD In kemari several people stand in a circle and kick a ball to each other trying not to let the ball drop to the ground much like keepie uppie An ancient Roman tombstone of a boy with a Harpastum ball from Tilurium modern Sinj Croatia Ancient Greece and Rome The Ancient Greeks and Romans are known to have played many ball games some of which involved the use of the feet The Roman game harpastum is believed to have been adapted from a Greek team game known as Episkyros or phaininda which is mentioned by a Greek playwright Antiphanes BC and later referred to by the Christian theologian Clement of Alexandria c c AD These games appear to have resembled rugby football The Roman politician Cicero BC describes the case of a man who was killed whilst having a shave when a ball was kicked into a barbers shop Roman ball games already knew the airfilled ball the follis Episkyros is described as an early form of football by FIFA Native Americans There are a number of references to traditional ancient or prehistoric ball games played by indigenous peoples in many different parts of the world For example in men from a ship commanded by an English explorer named John Davis went ashore to play a form of football with Inuit in Greenland There are later accounts of an Inuit game played on ice called Aqsaqtuk Each match began with two teams facing each other in parallel lines before attempting to kick the ball through each other teams line and then at a goal In William Strachey a colonist at Jamestown Virginia recorded a game played by Native Americans called Pahsaheman citation needed Pasuckuakohowog a game similar to modernday association football played amongst Amerindians was also reported as early as the th century Games played in Mesoamerica with rubber balls by indigenous peoples are also welldocumented as existing since before this time but these had more similarities to basketball or volleyball and no links have been found between such games and modern football sports Northeastern American Indians especially the Iroquois Confederation played a game which made use of net racquets to throw and catch a small ball however although it is a ballgoal foot game lacrosse as its modern descendant is called is likewise not usually classed as a form of football citation needed Oceania On the Australian continent several tribes of indigenous people played kicking and catching games with stuffed balls which have been generalised by historians as Marn Grook Djab Wurrung for game ball The earliest historical account is an anecdote from the book by Robert BroughSmyth The Aborigines of Victoria in which a man called Richard Thomas is quoted as saying in about in Victoria Australia that he had witnessed Aboriginal people playing the game Mr Thomas describes how the foremost player will drop kick a ball made from the skin of a possum and how other players leap into the air in order to catch it Some historians have theorised that Marn Grook was one of the origins of Australian rules football The Mori in New Zealand played a game called Korahi consisting of teams of seven players play on a circular field divided into zones and score points by touching the pou boundary markers and hitting a central tupu or target citation needed These games and others may well go far back into antiquity However the main sources of modern football codes appear to lie in western Europe especially England Turkic peoples Mahmud alKashgari in his Dwn Lught alTurk described a game called tepuk among Turks in Central and East Asia In the game people try to attack each others castle by kicking a ball made of sheep leather Ancient Greek athlete balancing a ball on his thigh Piraeus BC A Song dynasty painting by Su Hanchen c depicting Chinese children playing cuju Paint of a Mesoamerican ballgame player of the Tepantitla murals in Teotihuacan A group of indigenous people playing a ball game in French Guiana An illustration from the s of indigenous Australians playing marn grook A revived version of kemari being played at the Tanzan Shrine Japan Medieval and early modern Europe Further information Medieval football The Middle Ages saw a huge rise in popularity of annual Shrovetide football matches throughout Europe particularly in England An early reference to a ball game played in Britain comes from the thcentury Historia Brittonum attributed to Nennius which describes a party of boys playing at ball References to a ball game played in northern France known as La Soule or Choule in which the ball was propelled by hands feet and sticks date from the th century An illustration of socalled mob football The early forms of football played in England sometimes referred to as mob football would be played in towns or between neighbouring villages involving an unlimited number of players on opposing teams who would clash en masse struggling to move an item such as inflated animals bladder to particular geographical points such as their opponents church with play taking place in the open space between neighbouring parishes The game was played primarily during significant religious festivals such as Shrovetide Christmas or Easter and Shrovetide games have survived into the modern era in a number of English towns see below The first detailed description of what was almost certainly football in England was given by William FitzStephen in about He described the activities of London youths during the annual festival of Shrove Tuesday After lunch all the youth of the city go out into the fields to take part in a ball game The students of each school have their own ball the workers from each city craft are also carrying their balls Older citizens fathers and wealthy citizens come on horseback to watch their juniors competing and to relive their own youth vicariously you can see their inner passions aroused as they watch the action and get caught up in the fun being had by the carefree adolescents Most of the very early references to the game speak simply of ball play or playing at ball This reinforces the idea that the games played at the time did not necessarily involve a ball being kicked An early reference to a ball game that was probably football comes from at Ulgham Northumberland England Henry while playing at ball ran against David Football was played in Ireland in with a documented reference to John McCrocan a spectator at a football game at Newcastle County Down being charged with accidentally stabbing a player named William Bernard Another reference to a football game comes in at Shouldham Norfolk England during the game at ball as he kicked the ball a lay friend of his ran against him and wounded himself In Nicholas de Farndone Lord Mayor of the City of London issued a decree banning football in the French used by the English upper classes at the time A translation reads forasmuch as there is great noise in the city caused by hustling over large foot balls rageries de grosses pelotes de pee in the fields of the public from which many evils might arise which God forbid we command and forbid on behalf of the king on pain of imprisonment such game to be used in the city in the future This is the earliest reference to football In King Edward III of England issued a proclamation banning handball football or hockey coursing and cockfighting or other such idle games showing that football whatever its exact form in this case was being differentiated from games involving other parts of the body such as handball Football in France circa A game known as football was played in Scotland as early as the th century it was prohibited by the Football Act and although the law fell into disuse it was not repealed until There is evidence for schoolboys playing a football ball game in Aberdeen in some references cite which is notable as an early allusion to what some have considered to be passing the ball The word pass in the most recent translation is derived from huc percute strike it here and later repercute pilam strike the ball again in the original Latin It is not certain that the ball was being struck between members of the same team The original word translated as goal is metum literally meaning the pillar at each end of the circus course in a Roman chariot race There is a reference to get hold of the ball before another player does Praeripe illi pilam si possis agere suggesting that handling of the ball was allowed One sentence states in the original translation Throw yourself against him Age objice te illi King Henry IV of England also presented one of the earliest documented uses of the English word football in when he issued a proclamation forbidding the levying of money for foteball There is also an account in Latin from the end of the th century of football being played at Caunton Nottinghamshire This is the first description of a kicking game and the first description of dribbling the game at which they had met for common recreation is called by some the football game It is one in which young men in country sport propel a huge ball not by throwing it into the air but by striking it and rolling it along the ground and that not with their hands but with their feet kicking in opposite directions The chronicler gives the earliest reference to a football pitch stating that the boundaries have been marked and the game had started Oldest known painting of football in Scotland by Alexander Carse c Football in Scotland c Other firsts in the medieval and early modern eras A football in the sense of a ball rather than a game was first mentioned in This reference is in Dame Juliana Berners Book of St Albans It states a certain rounde instrument to play with it is an instrument for the foote and then it is calde in Latyn pila pedalis a fotebal A pair of football boots were ordered by King Henry VIII of England in Women playing a form of football was first described in by Sir Philip Sidney in one of his poems a tyme there is for all my mother often sayes when she with skirts tuckt very hy with girles at football playes The first references to goals are in the late th and early th centuries In and respectively John Norden and Richard Carew referred to goals in Cornish hurling Carew described how goals were made they pitch two bushes in the ground some eight or ten foote asunder and directly against them ten or twelue twelve score off other twayne in like distance which they terme their Goales He is also the first to describe goalkeepers and passing of the ball between players The first direct reference to scoring a goal is in John Day s play The Blind Beggar of Bethnal Green performed circa published Ill play a gole at campball an extremely violent variety of football which was popular in East Anglia Similarly in a poem in Michael Drayton refers to when the Ball to throw and drive it to the Gole in squadrons forth they goe Calcio Fiorentino Main article Calcio Fiorentino An illustration of the Calcio Fiorentino field and starting positions from a book by Pietro di Lorenzo Bini In the th century the city of Florence celebrated the period between Epiphany and Lent by playing a game which today is known as calcio storico historic kickball in the Piazza Santa Croce The young aristocrats of the city would dress up in fine silk costumes and embroil themselves in a violent form of football For example calcio players could punch shoulder charge and kick opponents Blows below the belt were allowed The game is said to have originated as a military training exercise In Count Giovanni de Bardi di Vernio wrote Discorso sopra l giuoco del Calcio Fiorentino This is sometimes said to be the earliest code of rules for any football game The game was not played after January until it was revived in May Official disapproval and attempts to ban football Main article Attempts to ban football games There have been many attempts to ban football from the Middle Ages through to the modern day The first such law was passed in England in it was followed by more than in England alone between and Women were banned from playing at English and Scottish Football League grounds in a ban that was only lifted in the s Female footballers still face similar problems in some parts of the world American football also faced pressures to ban the sport The game played in the th century resembled mob football that developed in medieval Europe including a version popular on university campuses known as old division football and several municipalities banned its play in the midth century By the th century the game had evolved to a more rugby style game In there were calls to ban American football in the US due to its violence a meeting that year was hosted by American president Theodore Roosevelt led to sweeping rules changes that caused the sport to diverge significantly from its rugby roots to become more like the sport as it is played today Establishment of modern codes English public schools Main article English public school football games While football continued to be played in various forms throughout Britain its public schools equivalent to private schools in other countries are widely credited with four key achievements in the creation of modern football codes First of all the evidence suggests that they were important in taking football away from its mob form and turning it into an organised team sport Second many early descriptions of football and references to it were recorded by people who had studied at these schools Third it was teachers students and former students from these schools who first codified football games to enable matches to be played between schools Finally it was at English public schools that the division between kicking and running or carrying games first became clear The earliest evidence that games resembling football were being played at English public schools mainly attended by boys from the upper uppermiddle and professional classes comes from the Vulgaria by William Herman in Herman had been headmaster at Eton and Winchester colleges and his Latin textbook includes a translation exercise with the phrase We wyll playe with a ball full of wynde Richard Mulcaster a student at Eton College in the early th century and later headmaster at other English schools has been described as the greatest sixteenth Century advocate of football Among his contributions are the earliest evidence of organised team football Mulcasters writings refer to teams sides and parties positions standings a referee judge over the parties and a coach trayning maister Mulcasters footeball had evolved from the disordered and violent forms of traditional football some smaller number with such overlooking sorted into sides and standings not meeting with their bodies so boisterously to trie their strength nor shouldring or shuffing one an other so barbarously may use footeball for as much good to the body by the chiefe use of the legges In David Wedderburn a teacher from Aberdeen mentioned elements of modern football games in a short Latin textbook called Vocabula Wedderburn refers to what has been translated into modern English as keeping goal and makes an allusion to passing the ball strike it here There is a reference to get hold of the ball suggesting that some handling was allowed It is clear that the tackles allowed included the charging and holding of opposing players drive that man back A more detailed description of football is given in Francis Willughby s Book of Games written in about Willughby who had studied at Bishop Veseys Grammar School Sutton Coldfield is the first to describe goals and a distinct playing field a close that has a gate at either end The gates are called Goals His book includes a diagram illustrating a football field He also mentions tactics leaving some of their best players to guard the goal scoring they that can strike the ball through their opponents goal first win and the way teams were selected the players being equally divided according to their strength and nimbleness He is the first to describe a law of football they must not strike an opponents leg higher than the ball English public schools were the first to codify football games In particular they devised the first offside rules during the late th century In the earliest manifestations of these rules players were off their side if they simply stood between the ball and the goal which was their objective Players were not allowed to pass the ball forward either by foot or by hand They could only dribble with their feet or advance the ball in a scrum or similar formation However offside laws began to diverge and develop differently at each school as is shown by the rules of football from Winchester Rugby Harrow and Cheltenham during between and The first known codes in the sense of a set of rules were those of Eton in and Aldenham in During the early th century most workingclass people in Britain had to work six days a week often for over twelve hours a day They had neither the time nor the inclination to engage in sport for recreation and at the time many children were part of the labour force Feast day football played on the streets was in decline Public school boys who enjoyed some freedom from work became the inventors of organised football games with formal codes of rules Football was adopted by a number of public schools as a way of encouraging competitiveness and keeping youths fit Each school drafted its own rules which varied widely between different schools and were changed over time with each new intake of pupils Two schools of thought developed regarding rules Some schools favoured a game in which the ball could be carried as at Rugby Marlborough and Cheltenham while others preferred a game where kicking and dribbling the ball was promoted as at Eton Harrow Westminster and Charterhouse The division into these two camps was partly the result of circumstances in which the games were played For example Charterhouse and Westminster at the time had restricted playing areas the boys were confined to playing their ball game within the school cloisters making it difficult for them to adopt rough and tumble running games citation needed Although the Rugby School pictured became famous due to a version that rugby football was invented there in most sports historians refuse this version stating it is apocryphal William Webb Ellis a pupil at Rugby School is said to have with a fine disregard for the rules of football as played in his time emphasis added first took the ball in his arms and ran with it thus creating the distinctive feature of the rugby game in This act is usually said to be the beginning of Rugby football but there is little evidence that it occurred and most sports historians believe the story to be apocryphal The act of taking the ball in his arms is often misinterpreted as picking the ball up as it is widely believed that Webb Ellis crime was handling the ball as in modern association football however handling the ball at the time was often permitted and in some cases compulsory the rule for which Webb Ellis showed disregard was running forward with it as the rules of his time only allowed a player to retreat backwards or kick forwards The boom in rail transport in Britain during the s meant that people were able to travel farther and with less inconvenience than they ever had before Interschool sporting competitions became possible However it was difficult for schools to play each other at football as each school played by its own rules The solution to this problem was usually that the match be divided into twohalves one half played by the rules of the host home school and the other half by the visiting away school The modern rules of many football codes were formulated during the mid or late th century This also applies to other sports such as lawn bowls lawn tennis etc The major impetus for this was the patenting of the worlds first lawnmower in This allowed for the preparation of modern ovals playing fields pitches grass courts etc Apart from Rugby football the public school codes have barely been played beyond the confines of each schools playing fields However many of them are still played at the schools which created them see British schools A Football Game by British painter Thomas Webster Public schools dominance of sports in the UK began to wane after the Factory Act of which significantly increased the recreation time available to working class children Before many British children had to work six days a week for more than twelve hours a day From they could not work before am am in winter or after pm on weekdays pm in winter on Saturdays they had to cease work at pm These changes meant that working class children had more time for games including various forms of football The earliest known matches between public schools are as follows Football match in the Shrove Tuesday in Kingston upon Thames England December Eton School v Harrow School s Old Rugbeians v Old Salopians played at Cambridge University s Old Rugbeians v Old Salopians played at Cambridge University the following year Harrow School v Westminster School Haileybury School v Westminster School February Forest School v Chigwell School Westminster School v

the world Notes about a Sheffield v Hallam match dated December Sports clubs dedicated to playing football began in the th century for example Londons Gymnastic Society which was founded in the midth century and ceased playing matches in The first documented club to bear in the title a reference to being a football club were called The FootBall Club who were located in Edinburgh Scotland during the period The club forbade tripping but allowed pushing and holding and the picking up of the ball In three boys at Rugby school were tasked with codifying the rules then being used at the school These were the first set of written rules or code for any form of football This further assisted the spread of the Rugby game The earliest known matches involving nonpublic school clubs or institutions are as follows February Charterhouse School v St Bartholemews Hospital November Bedford Grammar School v Bedford Town Gentlemen December Sunbury Military College v Littleton Gentlemen December Edinburgh University v Edinburgh Academical Club November Westminster School v Dingley Dell Club May Tavistock School v Princetown School November Eton School v Oxford University February Charterhouse School v Dingley Dell Club July Melbourne v Richmond December th Regiment v Sheffield December Sheffield v Hallam Competitions Main article Oldest football competitions One of the longest running football fixture is the CordnerEggleston Cup contested between Melbourne Grammar School and Scotch College Melbourne every year since It is believed by many to also be the first match of Australian rules football although it was played under experimental rules in its first year The first football trophy tournament was the Caledonian Challenge Cup donated by the Royal Caledonian Society of Melbourne played in under the Melbourne Rules The oldest football league is a rugby football competition the United Hospitals Challenge Cup while the oldest rugby trophy is the Yorkshire Cup contested since The South Australian Football Association April is the oldest surviving Australian rules football competition The oldest surviving soccer trophy is the Youdan Cup and the oldest national football competition is the English FA Cup The Football League is recognised as the longest running association football league The first international Rugby football match took place between Scotland and England on March at Raeburn Place Edinburgh The first international Association football match officially took place between sides representing England and Scotland on November at Hamilton Crescent the West of Scotland Cricket Club s ground in Partick Glasgow under the authority of the FA Modern balls Main article Football ball Richard Lindon seen in is believed to have invented the first footballs with rubber bladders In Europe early footballs were made out of animal bladders more specifically pigs bladders which were inflated Later leather coverings were introduced to allow the balls to keep their shape However in Richard Lindon and William Gilbert both shoemakers from the town of Rugby near the school exhibited both round and ovalshaped balls at the Great Exhibition in London Richard Lindons wife is said to have died of lung disease caused by blowing up pigs bladders a Lindon also won medals for the invention of the Rubber inflatable Bladder and the Brass Hand Pump In the US inventor Charles Goodyear who had patented vulcanised rubber exhibited a spherical football with an exterior of vulcanised rubber panels at the Paris Exhibition Universelle The ball was to prove popular in early forms of football in the US The iconic ball with a regular pattern of hexagons and pentagons see truncated icosahedron did not become popular until the s and was first used in the World Cup in Modern ball passing tactics Main article Passing association football The earliest reference to a game of football involving players passing the ball and attempting to score past a goalkeeper was written in by David Wedderburn a poet and teacher in Aberdeen Scotland Nevertheless the original text does not state whether the allusion to passing as kick the ball back repercute pilam was in a forward or backward direction or between members of the same opposing teams as was usual at this time Scientific football is first recorded in from Lancashire and in the modern game in rugby football from and from Sheffield FC as early as The first side to play a passing combination game was the Royal Engineers AFC in By they were working well together backing up and benefiting from cooperation By the Engineers were passing the ball Lieut Creswell who having brought the ball up the side then kicked it into the middle to another of his side who kicked it through the posts the minute before time was called Passing was a regular feature of their style By early the Engineers were the first football team renowned for playing beautifully together A double pass is first reported from Derby school against Nottingham Forest in March the first of which is irrefutably a short pass Mr Absey dribbling the ball half the length of the field delivered it to Wallis who kicking it cleverly in front of the goal sent it to the captain who drove it at once between the Nottingham posts The first side to have perfected the modern formation was Cambridge University AFC they also introduced the pyramid formation Rugby football Main articles Rugby football and History of rugby union The Last Scrimmage by Edwin Buckman depicting a rugby scrum in Rugby football was thought to have been started about at Rugby School in Rugby Warwickshire England although forms of football in which the ball was carried and tossed date to medieval times In Britain by there were clubs playing variations of the Rugby school game There were also rugby clubs in Ireland Australia Canada and New Zealand However there was no generally accepted set of rules for rugby until when clubs from London came together to form the Rugby Football Union RFU The first official RFU rules were adopted in June These rules allowed passing the ball They also included the try where touching the ball over the line allowed an attempt at goal though dropgoals from marks and general play and penalty conversions were still the main form of contest Regardless of any form of football the first international match between the national team of England and Scotland took place at Raeburn Place on March Rugby football split into Rugby union Rugby league American football and Canadian football Tom Wills played Rugby football in England before founding Australian rules football Cambridge rules Main article Cambridge rules During the nineteenth century several codifications of the rules of football were made at the University of Cambridge in order to enable students from different public schools to play each other The Cambridge Rules of influenced the decision of the Football Association to ban Rugbystyle carrying of the ball in its own first set of laws Sheffield rules Main article Sheffield rules By the late s many football clubs had been formed throughout the Englishspeaking world to play various codes of football Sheffield Football Club founded in in the English city of Sheffield by Nathaniel Creswick and William Prest was later recognised as the worlds oldest club playing association football However the club initially played its own code of football the Sheffield rules The code was largely independent of the public school rules the most significant difference being the lack of an offside rule The code was responsible for many innovations that later spread to association football These included free kicks corner kicks handball throwins and the crossbar By the s they became the dominant code in the north and midlands of England At this time a series of rule changes by both the London and Sheffield FAs gradually eroded the differences between the two games until the adoption of a common code in Australian rules football Main article Australian rules football See also Origins of Australian rules football Tom Wills major figure in the creation of Australian football There is archival evidence of football games being played in various parts of Australia throughout the first half of the th century The origins of an organised game of football known today as Australian rules football can be traced back to in Melbourne the capital city of Victoria In July Tom Wills an Australianborn cricketer educated at Rugby School in England wrote a letter to Bells Life in Victoria Sporting Chronicle calling for a football club with a code of laws to keep cricketers fit during winter This is considered by historians to be a defining moment in the creation of Australian rules football Through publicity and personal contacts Wills was able to coordinate football matches in Melbourne that experimented with various rules the first of which was played on July One week later Wills umpired a schoolboys match between Melbourne Grammar School and Scotch College Following these matches organised football in Melbourne rapidly increased in popularity Wood engraving of an Australian rules football match at the Richmond Paddock Melbourne Wills and others involved in these early matches formed the Melbourne Football Club the oldest surviving Australian football club on May Club members Wills William Hammersley J B Thompson and Thomas H Smith met with the intention of forming a set of rules that would be widely adopted by other clubs The committee debated rules used in English public school games Wills pushed for various rugby football rules he learnt during his schooling The first rules share similarities with these games and were shaped to suit to Australian conditions H C A Harrison a seminal figure in Australian football recalled that his cousin Wills wanted a game of our own The code was distinctive in the prevalence of the mark free kick tackling lack of an offside rule and that players were specifically penalised for throwing the ball The Melbourne football rules were widely distributed and gradually adopted by the other Victorian clubs The rules were updated several times during the s to accommodate the rules of other influential Victorian football clubs A significant redraft in by H C A Harrisons committee accommodated the Geelong Football Club s rules making the game then known as Victorian Rules increasingly distinct from other codes It soon adopted cricket fields and an oval ball used specialised goal and behind posts and featured bouncing the ball while running and spectacular high marking The game spread quickly to other Australian colonies Outside its heartland in southern Australia the code experienced a significant period of decline following World War I but has since grown throughout Australia and in other parts of the world and the Australian Football League emerged as the dominant professional competition The Football Association Main article The Football Association The first football international Scotland versus England Once kept by the Rugby Football Union as an early example of rugby football During the early s there were increasing attempts in England to unify and reconcile the various public school games In J C Thring who had been one of the driving forces behind the original Cambridge Rules was a master at Uppingham School and he issued his own rules of what he called The Simplest Game these are also known as the Uppingham Rules In early October another new revised version of the Cambridge Rules was drawn up by a seven member committee representing former pupils from Harrow Shrewsbury Eton Rugby Marlborough and Westminster At the Freemasons Tavern Great Queen Street London on the evening of October representatives of several football clubs in the London Metropolitan area met for the inaugural meeting of the Football Association FA The aim of the association was to establish a single unifying code and regulate the playing of the game among its members Following the first meeting the public schools were invited to join the association All of them declined except Charterhouse and Uppingham In total six meetings of the FA were held between October and December After the third meeting a draft set of rules were published However at the beginning of the fourth meeting attention was drawn to the recently published Cambridge Rules of The Cambridge rules differed from the draft FA rules in two significant areas namely running with carrying the ball and hacking kicking opposing players in the shins The two contentious FA rules were as follows IX A player shall be entitled to run with the ball towards his adversaries goal if he makes a fair catch or catches the ball on the first bound but in case of a fair catch if he makes his mark he shall not run X If any player shall run with the ball towards his adversaries goal any player on the opposite side shall be at liberty to charge hold trip or hack him or to wrest the ball from him but no player shall be held and hacked at the same time At the fifth meeting it was proposed that these two rules be removed Most of the delegates supported this but F M Campbell the representative from Blackheath and the first FA treasurer objected He said hacking is the true football However the motion to ban running with the ball in hand and hacking was carried and Blackheath withdrew from the FA After the final meeting on December the FA published the Laws of the Game the first comprehensive set of rules for the game later known as association football The term soccer in use since the late th century derives from an Oxford University abbreviation of association The first FA rules still contained elements that are no longer part of association football but which are still recognisable in other games such as Australian football and rugby football for instance a player could make a fair catch and claim a mark which entitled him to a free kick and if a player touched the ball behind the opponents goal line his side was entitled to a free kick at goal from yards metres in front of the goal line North American football codes Main articles Gridiron football History of American football and Canadian football History As was the case in Britain by the early th century North American schools and universities played their own local games between sides made up of students For example students at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire played a game called Old division football a variant of the association football codes as early as the s They remained largely mob football style games with huge numbers of players attempting to advance the ball into a goal area often by any means necessary Rules were simple violence and injury were common The violence of these mobstyle games led to widespread protests and a decision to abandon them Yale University under pressure from the city of New Haven banned the play of all forms of football in while Harvard University followed suit in In its place two general types of football evolved kicking games and running or carrying games A hybrid of the two known as the Boston game was played by a group known as the Oneida Football Club The club considered by some historians as the first formal football club in the United States was formed in by schoolboys who played the Boston game on Boston Common The game began to return to American college campuses by the late s The universities of Yale Princeton then known as the College of New Jersey Rutgers and Brown all began playing kicking games during this time In Princeton used rules based on those of the English Football Association The Tigers of Hamilton Ontario circa Founded as the Hamilton Foot Ball Club they eventually merged with the Hamilton Flying Wildcats to form the Hamilton TigerCats a team still active in the Canadian Football League In Canada the first documented football match was a practice game played on November at University College University of Toronto approximately yards west of Queens Park One of the participants in the game involving University of Toronto students was Sir William Mulock later Chancellor of the school In at Trinity College Toronto F Barlow Cumberland Frederick A Bethune and Christopher Gwynn one of the founders of Milton Massachusetts devised rules based on rugby football A running game resembling rugby football was then taken up by the Montreal Football Club in Canada in Rutgers University here pictured in played the first intercollegiate football game v Princeton in On November Rutgers faced Princeton in a game that was played with a round ball and like all early games used improvised rules It is usually regarded as the first game of American intercollegiate football The Harvard v McGill game in It is considered the first rugby football game played in the United States Modern North American football grew out of a match between McGill University of Montreal and Harvard University in During the game the two teams alternated between the rugbybased rules used by McGill and the Boston Game rules used by Harvard Within a few years Harvard had both adopted McGills rules and persuaded other US university teams to do the same On November representatives from Harvard Yale Princeton and Columbia met at the Massasoit Convention in Springfield Massachusetts agreeing to adopt most of the Rugby Football Union rules with some variations In Yale coach Walter Camp who had become a fixture at the Massasoit House conventions where the rules were debated and changed devised a number of major innovations Camps two most important rule changes that diverged the American game from rugby were replacing the scrummage with the line of scrimmage and the establishment of the downanddistance rules American football still however remained a violent sport where collisions often led to serious injuries and sometimes even death This led US President Theodore Roosevelt to hold a meeting with football representatives from Harvard Yale and Princeton on October urging them to make drastic changes One rule change introduced in devised to open up the game and reduce injury was the introduction of the legal forward pass Though it was underutilised for years this proved to be one of the most important rule changes in the establishment of the modern game Over the years Canada absorbed some of the developments in American football in an effort to distinguish it from a more rugbyoriented game In the Ontario Rugby Football Union adopted the Burnside rules which implemented the line of scrimmage and downanddistance system from American football among others Canadian football then implemented the legal forward pass in American and Canadian football remain different codes stemming from rule changes that the American side of the border adopted but the Canadian side has not Gaelic football Main article History of Gaelic football The AllIreland Football Final in Croke Park In the midth century various traditional football games referred to collectively as caid remained popular in Ireland especially in County Kerry One observer Father W Ferris described two main forms of caid during this period the field game in which the object was to put the ball through archlike goals formed from the boughs of two trees and the epic crosscountry game which took up most of the daylight hours of a Sunday on which it was played and was won by one team taking the ball across a parish boundary Wrestling holding opposing players and carrying the ball were all allowed By the s rugby and association football had started to become popular in Ireland Trinity College Dublin was an early stronghold of rugby see the Developments in the s section above The rules of the English FA were being distributed widely Traditional forms of caid had begun to give way to a roughandtumble game which allowed tripping There was no serious attempt to unify and codify Irish varieties of football until the establishment of the Gaelic Athletic Association GAA in The GAA sought to promote traditional Irish sports such as hurling and to reject imported games like rugby and association football The first Gaelic football rules were drawn up by Maurice Davin and published in the United Ireland magazine on February Davins rules showed the influence of games such as hurling and a desire to formalise a distinctly Irish code of football The prime example of this differentiation was the lack of an offside rule an attribute which for many years was shared only by other Irish games like hurling and by Australian rules football Schism in Rugby football Further information History of rugby league An English cartoon from the s lampooning the divide in rugby football which led to the formation of rugby league The caricatures are of Rev Frank Marshall an archopponent of player payments and James Miller a longtime opponent of Marshall The caption reads Marshall Oh fie go away naughty boy I dont play with boys who cant afford to take a holiday for football any day they like Miller Yes thats just you to a T youd make it so that no lad whose father wasnt a millionaire could play at all in a really good team For my part I see no reason why the men who make the money shouldnt have a share in the spending of it The International Rugby Football Board IRFB was founded in but rifts were beginning to emerge in the code Professionalism had already begun to creep into the various codes of football In England by the s a longstanding Rugby Football Union ban on professional players was causing regional tensions within rugby football as many players in northern England were working class and could not afford to take time off to train travel play and recover from injuries This was not very different from what had occurred ten years earlier in soccer in Northern England but the authorities reacted very differently in the RFU attempting to alienate the working class support in Northern England In following a dispute about a player being paid broken time payments which replaced wages lost as a result of playing rugby representatives of the northern clubs met in Huddersfield to form the Northern Rugby Football Union NRFU The new body initially permitted only various types of player wage replacements However within two years NRFU players could be paid but they were required to have a job outside sport The demands of a professional league dictated that rugby had to become a better spectator sport Within a few years the NRFU rules had started to diverge from the RFU most notably with the abolition of the lineout This was followed by the replacement of the ruck with the playtheball ruck which allowed a twoplayer ruck contest between the tackler at marker and the player tackled Mauls were stopped once the ball carrier was held being replaced by a playthe ballruck The separate Lancashire and Yorkshire competitions of the NRFU merged in forming the Northern Rugby League the first time the name rugby league was used officially in England Over time the RFU form of rugby played by clubs which remained members of national federations affiliated to the IRFB became known as rugby union Globalisation of association football Main article History of FIFA The need for a single body to oversee association football had become apparent by the beginning of the th century with the increasing popularity of international fixtures The English Football Association had chaired many discussions on setting up an international body but was perceived as making no progress It fell to associations from seven other European countries France Belgium Denmark Netherlands Spain Sweden and Switzerland to form an international association The Fdration Internationale de Football Association FIFA was founded in Paris on May Its first president was Robert Gurin The French name and acronym has remained even outside Frenchspeaking countries Further divergence of the two rugby codes Rugby league rules diverged significantly from rugby union in with the reduction of the team from to players In a New Zealand professional rugby team toured Australia and Britain receiving an enthusiastic response and professional rugby leagues were launched in Australia the following year However the rules of professional games varied from one country to another and negotiations between various national bodies were required to fix the exact rules for each international match This situation endured until when at the instigation of the French league the Rugby League International Federation RLIF was formed at a meeting in Bordeaux During the second half of the th century the rules changed further In rugby league officials borrowed the American football concept of downs a team was allowed to retain possession of the ball for four tackles rugby union retains the original rule that a player who is tackled and brought to the ground must release the ball immediately The maximum number of tackles was later increased to six in and in rugby league this became known as the six tackle rule With the advent of fulltime professionals in the early s and the consequent speeding up of the game the fivemetre offside distance between the two teams became metres and the replacement rule was superseded by various interchange rules among other changes The laws of rugby union also changed during the th century although less significantly than those of rugby league In particular goals from marks were abolished kicks directly into touch from outside the metre line were penalised new laws were put in place to determine who had possession following an inconclusive ruck or maul and the lifting of players in lineouts was legalised In rugby union became an open game that is one which allowed professional players Although the original dispute between the two codes has now disappeared and despite the fact that officials from both forms of rugby football have sometimes mentioned the possibility of reunification the rules of both codes and their culture have diverged to such an extent that such an event is unlikely in the foreseeable future Use of the word football Further information Football word The word football when used in reference to a specific game can mean any one of those described above Because of this much controversy has occurred over the term football primarily because it is used in different ways in different parts of the Englishspeaking world Most often the word football is used to refer to the code of football that is considered dominant within a particular region which is association football in most countries So effectively what the word football means usually depends on where one says it Heading from The Sportsman London front page of November illustrating the continued use of the word football to encompass both association football and rugby In each of the United Kingdom the United States and Canada one football code is known solely as football while the others generally require a qualifier In New Zealand football historically referred to rugby union but more recently may be used unqualified to refer to association football The sport meant by the word football in Australia is either Australian rules football or rugby league depending on local popularity which largely conforms to the Barassi Line In francophone Quebec where Canadian football is more popular the Canadian code is known as le football while American football is known as le football amricain and association football is known as le soccer Of the national FIFA Fdration Internationale de Football Association affiliates in which English is an official or primary language most currently use Football in their organisations official names the FIFA affiliates in Canada and the United States use Soccer in their names A few FIFA affiliates have recently normalised to using Football including Australias association football governing body changed its name in from using soccer to football New Zealands governing body

Several of the football codes are the most popular team sports in the world Globally association football is played by over million players in over nations and has the highest television audience in
